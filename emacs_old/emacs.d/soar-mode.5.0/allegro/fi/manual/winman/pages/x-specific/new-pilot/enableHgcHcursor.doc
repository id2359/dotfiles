    FUNCTION
    enable-gc-cursor  -  turn on the gc-cursor

    Usage
    enable-gc-cursor

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The gc-cursor will be displayed whenever the  a  garbage  collection  is
    taking  place.   While  the  cursor is displayed, mouse button cannot be
    used with any X application.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns an integer (whose value is undetermined and of no significance),
    but this function is called for its side effects.  The gc cursor will be
    displayed whenever LISP is garbage collecting.  The cursor (which resem-
    bles  a  hourglass)  indicates that  (and COMMON WINDOWS) cannot do any-
    thing until the garbage collection is finished.

    The cost of using the gc cursor is that the mouse buttons  are  disabled
    for any X application (not just COMMON WINDOWS) until the gc is finished
    and the cursor changes back.  You must weigh the costs and  benefits  of
    using the gc cursor.

    The gc cursor can also be enabled when  COMMON  WINDOWS  is  initialized
    with  initialize-common-windows  (by  specifying a non-nil value for the
    :gc-cursor  argument).    The   gc   cursor   can   be   disabled   with
    disable-gc-cursor.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Turn on the gc-cursor.
    (enable-gc-cursor)
    ;;  Force a gc. The gc-cursor will be displayed.
    (excl:gc t)
    ;;  Turn off the gc-cursor.
    (disable-gc-cursor)
