    FUNCTION
    force-graphics-output  -  force immediate sending of all buffered output
      to the server

    Usage
    force-graphics-output

    SIDE EFFECTS
    All buffered output is sent to the server.

    DESCRIPTION
    COMMON WINDOWS maintains a buffer for graphics output, which is  emptied
    automatically,  but  the  user  may  exert more control, if desired.  In
    addition, it is possible (and computationally VERY efficient) to  buffer
    up  a  series of graphics commands by enclosing them in a with-graphics-
    batching form .

    EXAMPLES
    (force-graphics-output)
