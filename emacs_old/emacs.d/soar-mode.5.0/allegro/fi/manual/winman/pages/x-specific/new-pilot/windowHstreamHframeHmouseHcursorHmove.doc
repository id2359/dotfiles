    FUNCTION
    window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-move  -  get the list of functions
      called by the frame-mouse-cursor-move method

    Usage
    window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-move WSTREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the list of functions that will be called when the  frame-mouse-
    cursor-move  method  for  the  window-stream  WSTREAM  is  called.  Move
    methods are only called if catching of move events has been enabled with
    control-mouse-cursor-move-events.   See the entry on frame-mouse-cursor-
    move for information on enabling catching of move events.  In any  case,
    this  function returns the list of function which are called if catching
    of move events is enabled.

    Initially, the list contains the single function  default-window-stream-
    frame-mouse-cursor-move-method,  which  does  nothing except return nil.
    You can add functions to (and remove  functions  from)  this  list  with
    modify-window-stream-method.   You  can  replace  the list entirely with
    this function and setf.   restore-default-window-stream-method  restores
    the list to its initial contents.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We make a window.
    (setf *my-win* (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 200
                                       :width 100 :height 100
                                       :activate-p t))

    ;;  The initial list contains one function.
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-move *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-mouse-cursor-move-method)
    ;;  We add FOO to the list (we assume it is defined elsewhere).
    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :frame-mouse-cursor-move
                                 :after 'foo)

    ;;  Now the list contains two functions.
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-move *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-mouse-cursor-move-method foo)

    ;;  We restore the list to its initial state.
    (restore-default-window-stream-method *my-win*
      :frame-mouse-cursor-move)
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-move *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-mouse-cursor-move-method)
