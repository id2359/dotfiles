    Usage

    this  function,  in  conjunction with setf to provide a mouse cursor for
    WSTREAM.  In the current implementation, you must use one of the  prede-

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We make a window to display each predefined
    ;;  mouse cursor.
    (let ((left 50)(bottom 10))
      (dolist (i cw::*mouse-cursor-list*)
              (let ((w (make-window-stream
                        :left left
                        :bottom left
                        :width 100
                        :height 100 :activate-p t
                        :title (princ-to-string (/ left 50)))))
                (setf (window-stream-mouse-cursor w)
                      (eval i))
                (add-right-button-menu w)
                (incf left 25)
                (incf bottom 25))))
