    FUNCTION
    window-stream-mouse-cursor-move  -  get the list of functions called by
      mouse-cursor-move method

    Usage
    window-stream-mouse-cursor-move WSTREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  the  list  of  functions  that  will   be   called   when   the
    mouse-cursor-move  method  for the window-stream WSTREAM is called.  You
    can replace this list by using setf,  or  modify  it  by  using  modify-
    window-stream-method.    Use   restore-default-window-stream-method   to
    restore the list to its default contents.

    The list returned by window-stream-mouse-cursor-move initially  consists
    of  the  single  element default-window-stream-mouse-cursor-move-method,
    which is a function that does nothing at all.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We make a window.
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 200
                              :width 100 :height 100
                              :activate-p t))

    (defun my-after-mouse-cursor-move (wstream &rest args)
      (declare (ignore args))
          (format  *standard-output*
                   "Position: ~S ~% "
                   (mouse-state-position mouse-state)))

    (control-mouse-curspor-move-events *my-win*
                                       :pointer-motion t)
    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :mouse-cursor-move
                                  :after 'my-after-mouse-cursor-move)

    ;;  Now whenever the mouse moves in *my-win* we
    ;;  can monitor the mouse position.

    ;;  We look at the list of functions.
    (window-stream-mouse-cursor-move *my-win*))
      =>  (default-window-stream-mouse-cursor-move-method
            my-after-mouse-cursor-move)
