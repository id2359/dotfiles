    FUNCTION
    mouse-cursor-x-hotspot  -

    Usage
    mouse-cursor-x-hotspot X

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the horizontal component of  the  hotspot  of  the  mouse-cursor
    CURSOR.   The hotspot of a mouse cursor is the location, with respect to
    the bitmap of the mouse cursor, of the cursor when viewed  as  a  single
    point.   For  example, the hotspot might be at the tip of a mouse cursor
    that comes to a point.

    This accessor has meaning only when applied to mouse  cursors  that  are
    bitmaps, and not the predefined mouse cursors provided by X.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq w (make-window-stream :activate-p t :title "My Window"))

    (setf (window-stream-mouse-cursor w)
      (make-mouse-cursor
       :foreground-color black
       :background-color white
       :y-hotspot 10
       :source-index 3
       :mask-index 3
       ))

    (defun my-left-button-down (wstream &rest args)
          (declare (ignore  args))
          (draw-point wstream  (mouse-position wstream)
                      :brush-width 5))

    (modify-window-stream-method w :left-button-down
                                 :after about-my-left-button-down)
