    FUNCTION
    flush-mouse-cursor  -  destroy a mouse cursor

    Usage
    flush-mouse-cursor MOUSE-CURSOR

    SIDE EFFECTS
    Destroys the mouse cursor MOUSE-CURSOR, freeing up foreign storage asso-
    ciated  with  it.  The effect in areas where the mouse cursor is used is
    undefined.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil after flushing the cursor.  Unless space is really an issue,
    there  is  no reason to flush mouse cursors.  Be sure that the cursor is
    not used anywhere before flushing it.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following creates a mouse cursor.
    (setq my-mouse-cursor
      (make-mouse-cursor
       :foreground-color black
       :background-color white
       :source-index 4
       :mask-index 4
       ))

    ;;  The cursor is destroyed with FLUSH-MOUSE-CURSOR.
    (flush-mouse-cursor my-mouse-cursor) => nil
