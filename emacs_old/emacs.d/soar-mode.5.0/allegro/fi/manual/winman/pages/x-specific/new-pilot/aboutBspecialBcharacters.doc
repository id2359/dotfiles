    NOTES
    about special characters  -  special characters for listeners and rubout
      handlers

    DESCRIPTION
    COMMON WINDOWS defines a set of special characters  which  are  used  in
    cases  where  COMMON  WINDOWS  accepts input.  Lisp listeners and rubout
    handlers use these characters.  The list of such  characters  and  their
    associated  COMMON  WINDOWS  variables  follows.   The initial values of
    these variables are set when COMMON WINDOWS is  initialized  by  polling
    the  environment  of the shell that started the LISP.  For more informa-
    tion on these characters, see the Unix documentation for stty.

            *brk-char*      break
            *eof-char*      end of file
            *erase-char*    erase
            *intr-char*     interrupt
            *kill-char*     kill
            *quit-char*     quit
            *start-char*    start
            *stop-char*     stop

    EXAMPLES
    ;; The example shows some possible values for these variables
    ;; The results will differ depending on
    ;; how you have set up your shell environment.
    *brk-char* => #\%rubout
    *eof-char* => #\^d
    *erase-char* => #\rubout
    *intr-char* => #\^c
    *kill-char* => #\^u
    *quit-char* => #\^
    *start-char* => #\^q
    *stop-char* => #\^s
