    FUNCTION
    common-windows-initialized-p  -  test whether COMMON WINDOWS is initial-
      ized

    Usage
    common-windows-initialized-p

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if COMMON WINDOWS is initialized, otherwise returns  false.
    You  initialize  COMMON  WINDOWS  with  the  function initialize-common-
    windows, and kill them with  kill-common-windows.   If  LISP  is  dumped
    while  COMMON WINDOWS is running, this function will return true (in the
    new LISP), even if COMMON WINDOWS has not been restarted.  In that case,
    however,  connected-to-server-p  will  return false.  You restart COMMON
    WINDOWS in a dumped image with restart-common-windows.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  break the NeWS connection
    (kill-common-windows)
    (common-windows-initialized-p) => nil
    ;;  reestablish the NeWS connection
    (initialize-common-windows)
    (common-windows-initialized-p) => t
