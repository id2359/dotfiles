    FUNCTION
    draw-to-xy  -  draw to a point on a graphic stream

    Usage
    draw-to-xy GR-STREAM POSITION [:brush-width BRUSH-WIDTH] [:color COLOR]
      [:dashing DASHING] [:operation OPERATION]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A line segment is drawn on the graphic stream GR-STREAM from the current
    position  of  the  output cursor to the position determined by the argu-
    ments x and y, which must be integers.  These  positions  are  expressed
    with respect to the extent coordinate system.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  The method works  with  both  types  of  graphic  streams,
    BITMAP  STREAMS  and  WINDOW STREAMS.  For a function which draws a line
    segment from one specified position to another, see draw-line.

    The keyword argument :brush-width is the width, in pixels, of the points
    that  are drawn.  The default value is the value of window-stream-brush-
    width applied to gr-stream.  The keyword argument  :operation  specifies
    the  boolean  operation that will be used when the bits from the drawing
    operation are combined with the bits on the graphic stream.  This  argu-
    ment  defaults  to  the  value  of  window-stream-operation  applied  to
    GR-STREAM.  All the sixteen standard boolean operations of  COMMON  LISP
    are  supported.   The  keyword  argument  :color,  specifies the drawing
    color, and defaults to the value returned  by  window-stream-foreground-
    color applied to GR-STREAM.

    The keyword argument :dashing is a  list  which  specifies  the  dashing
    pattern  of  the  line.  For example, the dashing pattern (1 2 3 4) says
    that one bit should be turned on followed by 2 bits turned off  followed
    by  3 bits turned on followed by 4 bits turned off, and then the pattern
    repeated throughout the drawing operation.  If the length of the list is
    odd,  then  the  dashing  pattern  cycles.  For example the list (1 2 3)
    would produce the dashing pattern (1 on, 2 off, 3 on)  (1 off, 2  on,  3
    off),  etc.   A  dashing  pattern that consists of a single integer is a
    shorthand for the integer repeated twice in the usual  list  representa-
    tion.   For  example,  if  DASHING  is 2, then this is equivalent to the
    dashing pattern (2 2) .

    The argument GR-STREAM may be either a window-stream  or  bitmap-stream.
    These  are  the  only  two types of graphic streams, with the difference
    between them being that  bitmap-streams  must  be  bitblted  to  window-
    streams.

    The function window-stream-draw-to-xy returns the list of functions that
    this  method  calls.  You can change this list by using setf and window-
    stream-draw-to-xy or  by  using  modify-window-stream-method.   You  can
    restore  the  list  to  its original default state with restore-default-
    window-stream-method.

    The draw-to-xy method returns what is returned by the last  function  in
    the  list  of  functions called by the method. If this list has not been
    changed from its initial value, draw-to-xy returns nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream
           :left 100
           :bottom 300
           :width 300
           :height 300
           :activate-p t))

    (reset *my-win*)
    ;;  We draw to a point in the center of the output region.
    (draw-to-xy *my-win*
                150 150
                :brush-width 2
                )
