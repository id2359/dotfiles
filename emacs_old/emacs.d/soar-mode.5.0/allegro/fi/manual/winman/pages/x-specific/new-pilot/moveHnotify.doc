    METHOD
    move-notify  -  method called when X moves a window

    Usage
    move-notify WSTREAM POSITION

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns   what   the   last   function   in   the   list   returned   by
    window-stream-move-notify  returns.   When  the X window-manager moves a
    common window, it informs COMMON WINDOWS that it has done  so  to  allow
    COMMON  WINDOWS to update its information on window status.  COMMON WIN-
    DOWS calls this method, which in turn calls all the  functions  returned
    by  window-stream-move-notify applied to WSTREAM.  You do not (normally)
    call this function directly.

    The initial value of the list returned by window-stream-move-notify con-
    tains   the  single  function  default-window-stream-move-notify-method.
    This function does the work of updating COMMON WINDOWS so you should not
    remove  it from the list.  You may add new functions to the list for any
    window-stream with modify-window-stream-method.   You  may  replace  the
    whole  list  with  setf  and  window-stream-move-notify  but  be sure to
    include default-window-stream-move-notify-method in the new  list.   The
    function  restore-default-window-stream-method  restores the list to its
    original value.

    Any function added to the list must accept  two  arguments,  the  window
    stream, WSTREAM, and the new position of its lower left corner.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
                (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
                :width 200 :height 200
                :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (window-stream-move-notify *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-move-notify-method)

    (defun my-before-move-notify (w pos)
      (declare (ignore pos))
      (setf (window-stream-get w 'old-pos)
        (window-stream-position w)))

    (defun my-after-move-notify (w pos)
       (declare (ignore pos))
      (move w (window-stream-get w 'old-pos)))

    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :move-notify
                           :after 'my-after-move-notify)

    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :move-notify
                           :before 'my-before-move-notify)
    (window-stream-move-notify  *my-win*)
      => (my-before-move-notify
           default-window-stream-move-notify-method
           my-after-move-notify)
    ;;  Now when you use the X window manager to move the window
    ;;  LISP will move it back to where it started.
