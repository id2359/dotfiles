    FUNCTION
    install-colormap  -  install a LISP colormap and its associated server
      colormap

    Usage
    install-colormap COLORMAP

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The server colormap associated with the argument  COLORMAP  becomes  the
    installed  server colormap.  Every pixel on the screen has an index into
    the server colormap.  All these indices will  now  refer  to  the  newly
    installed  colormap and windows put up by clients other than COMMON WIN-
    DOWS (and perhaps some common windows too) will appear with colors  dif-
    ferent than intended.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil but this function is used for its side  effects.   The  LISP
    colormap  denoted  by  the  COLORMAP argument becomes the installed LISP
    colormap and its associated server colormap becomes the installed server
    colormap.

    Installing colormaps may be done automatically by the window manager, if
    you are using a window managers.  When the mouse cursor enters a window,
    window managers which are ICCCM compliant will automatically install the
    server  colormap associated with the colormap returned by window-stream-
    colormap applied to the window-steam.  Other window  managers  will  not
    and  you  will have to call install-colormap directly.  (The only effect
    of installing a LISP colormap is to cause the associated server colormap
    to be installed.)

    It is unusual, though permitted, to use more than one colormap in COMMON
    WINDOWS.   We recommend that either you use the default colormap only or
    you create a new colormap and use it only.   (The  default  colormap  is
    defined  when  COMMON  WINDOWS  is  initialized.   It  is  the  value of
    *default-colormap*)

    The function uninstall-colormap is used to restore the colormap that was
    in  force  before  the call to install-colormap.  ICCCM compliant window
    managers will call this function when the mouse cursor exits a window.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
      (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
                          :width 200 :height 200
                          :activate-p t :title "Just a Window Lois"))

    ;; This will be an array to store some colors.
    (setq colors (make-array 10))
    (dotimes (i 10)
      (setf (elt colors i)(make-color :level (/ i 10))))

    ;; Create a new colormap and install the colors in it.

    (setq my-colormap (create-colormap :preallocate (list white black)))

    (dotimes (i 10)
      (install-color  (elt colors i) my-colormap))

    ;; Make my-colormap the current colormap used by the server.

    (install-colormap  my-colormap)

    ;; You should see circles in 10 shades of gray.
    (dotimes (i 10)
      (draw-filled-circle
       *my-win*
       (make-position :x (* i 10) :y  (* i 10)) 50
                      :color (elt colors i)))
