    FUNCTION
    draw-point-xy  -  draw a point on a graphic stream

    Usage
    draw-point-xy GR-STREAM X Y [:brush-width BRUSH-WIDTH] [:operation
      OPERATION] [:color COLOR]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A point is drawn on the graphic stream GR-STREAM at the position  deter-
    mined by the arguments X and Y, which must be integers.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  The coordinates are given with respect to the extent coor-
    dinate system of GR-STREAM.  For a function which passes the coordinates
    bundled in a POSITION data structure, see draw-point.

    The keyword argument :brush-width is the width, in pixels, of the  point
    that  is  drawn.   This argument defaults to the value of window-stream-
    brush-width applied to GR-STREAM.  The  default  value  is  The  keyword
    argument  :operation  specifies  the boolean operation that will be used
    when the bits from the drawing operation are combined with the  bits  on
    the  graphic  stream.   This  argument  defaults to the value of window-
    stream-operation applied to GR-STREAM.  All the sixteen standard boolean
    operations  of  COMMON LISP are supported.  The keyword argument :color,
    specifies the drawing color, and  defaults  to  the  value  returned  by
    window-stream-foreground-color applied to GR-STREAM.

    The argument GR-STREAM may be either a window-stream  or  bitmap-stream.
    These  are  the  only  two types of graphic streams, with the difference
    between them being that  bitmap-streams  must  be  bitblted  to  window-
    streams.

    The function window-stream-draw-point-xy returns the list  of  functions
    that  this  method  calls.   You  can change this list by using setf and
    window-stream-draw-point-xy  or  by  using  modify-window-stream-method.
    You  can  restore  the  list to its original default state with restore-
    default-window-stream-method.

    The draw-point-xy method returns what is returned by the  last  function
    in the list of functions called by the method. If this list has not been
    changed from its initial value, draw-point-xy returns nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream
           :lefot 100
           :bottom 300
           :width 300
           :height 300
           :activate-p t))
    ;;  We draw a point in the center of the output region.
    (draw-point-xy *my-win*
                150 150
                :brush-width 2
                )
