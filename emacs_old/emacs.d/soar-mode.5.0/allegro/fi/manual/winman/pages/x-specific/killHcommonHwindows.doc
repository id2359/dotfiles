    FUNCTION
    kill-common-windows  -  stop execution of Common Windows and free
      resources

    Usage
    kill-common-windows

    SIDE EFFECTS
    This function closes all windows, frees up all resources used by  COMMON
    WINDOWS, and breaks the Lisp connection to the X server.  In addition it
    flushes the queue of mouse and keyboard events.

    DESCRIPTION
    This function returns what the last function in the list  bound  to  the
    global variable *kill-common-windows-actions* returns.  The intention is
    that you can change the contents of this list, and  thus  customize  the
    behavior  of the system.  In the default case, this list consists of the
    single item default-kill-common-windows.  Since this function  does  the
    crucial  work of killing COMMON WINDOWS you should insure that it is not
    removed from the list.

    After executing kill-common-windows, you should call  initialize-common-
    windows to get COMMON WINDOWS running again.

    If you try restart-common-windows  after  callling  kill-common-windows,
    the  system  will  call  initialize-common-windows  instead.   (restart-
    common-windows is meant to be used in cases where there is some  graphic
    state to be preserved.  You can preserve your graphic state for a future
    session by using excl:dumplisp, then using  restart-common-windows  when
    you start up the dumped image again.)

    EXAMPLES
    (kill-common-windows)
    (make-window-stream) => ERROR
    ;;  you cannot make a window unless Common Windows is running.  You
    ;;  must reinitialize Common Windows after killing them in order to
    ;;  make a window.
