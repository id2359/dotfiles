    FUNCTION
    swap-colors  -  interchange two colors

    Usage
    swap-colors COLOR1 COLOR2

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a list of the colors swapped, but this function is used for  its
    side  effects.  The red, green, and blue values in the colors identified
    by the arguments  COLOR1  and  COLOR2  are  swapped.   (All  colors  are
    represented by values of red, green, and blue, even though colors can be
    defined in other ways.)  Both COLOR1 and COLOR2 must be read-write  (NOT
    read-only) colors.

    If either color is initialized (meaning that it is installed in  a  LISP
    colormap  and the associated server colormap) the values in those color-
    maps are also changed.  After the swap has completed, all pixels on  the
    screen  previously  displayed  in COLOR1 will be displayed in COLOR2 and
    vice versa.

    The related function rotate-colors changes all the colors in a  list  or
    vector of colors.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
      (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
                          :width 200 :height 200
                          :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (setq color1 (make-color :red 1.0 :green 0.0 :blue 0.0))
    (setq color2 (make-color :red 0.0 :green 1.0 :blue 0.0))
    (color-green color1) => 0.0d0
    (color-red color1) => 1.0d0
    (color-green color2) => 1.0d0
    (color-red color2) => 0.0d0

    (draw-filled-circle *my-win* (make-position :x 30 :y  50) 20
                        :color color1)
    (draw-filled-circle *my-win* (make-position :x 50 :y  50) 20
                        :color color2)
    ;;  The right circle is green and the left red.  After we
    ;;  evaluate the next form, the right circle will be red
    ;;  and the left green.
    (swap-colors color1 color2)

    ;;  The colors themselves are changed:
    (color-green color1) => 1.0d0
    (color-red color1) => 0.0d0
    (color-green color2) => 0.0d0
    (color-red color2) => 1.0d0

    ;;  You may not swap read-only colors.  The eight
    ;;  predefined colors are read-only.
    (swap-colors red blue) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is "Error: Cannot rotate a read-only color..."
