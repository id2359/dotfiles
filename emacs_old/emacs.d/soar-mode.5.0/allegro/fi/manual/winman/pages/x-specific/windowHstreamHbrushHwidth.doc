    FUNCTION
    window-stream-brush-width  -  get the default drawing operation brush
      width for a window-stream or bitmap-stream

    Usage
    window-stream-brush-width GR-STREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the default brush width for  drawing  operations  on  GR-STREAM,
    which  must be either a winow-stream or a bitmap-stream.  Unfilled draw-
    ing functions have a :brush-width keyword argument  that  specifies  the
    width of the line which will draw the particular figure.  If no value is
    specified for that argument, its default value is taken from this  func-
    tion.   The  value  returned  by this function is initially 1 and may be
    changed with setf.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
            (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
            :width 200 :height 200
            :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (window-stream-brush-width *my-win*) => 1
    (setf (window-stream-brush-width *my-win*) 5) => 5
    (window-stream-brush-width *my-win*) => 5
