    FUNCTION
    window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out  -  get the list of functions
      called by the frame-mouse-cursor-out method

    Usage
    window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out WSTREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  the  list  of  functions  that  will   be   called   when   the
    frame-mouse-cursor-out  method  for the window-stream WSTREAM is called.
    The system calls this function when the mouse cursor moves from the win-
    dow  frame  (the  borders and title region) to OUTSIDE the window.  (The
    method is NOT called when the cursor moves from the frame to inside  the
    window.) You do not (normally) call this function directly.

    Note that enabling entent  scrolling  on  WSTREAM  (with  enable-window-
    stream-extent-scrolling)  the system will replace the entire list with a
    new list containing the function  x-common-windows::maybe-pop-up-scroll-
    bar.   This function brings up scroll bars when necessary.  Thus, if you
    want to add your own function to this method and you  intend  to  enable
    scrolling,  you  should  add  the  functions after scrolling is enabled.
    Also, if scrolling is disabled, the list  is  restored  to  its  initial
    state, and your added functions are lost.

    If scroll bars are not enabled, the list of functions initially contains
    the single function default-window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out-method.
    This function simply returns nil.  As we said  above,  if  scrolling  is
    enabled,  the list contains the single function x-common-windows::maybe-
    pop-up-scroll-bar.  In either case, you can add functions to (or  remove
    functions  from)  this  list  with modify-window-stream-method.  You can
    replace the entire list  with  window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out  and
    setf.    (If   scrolling  is  enabled,  be  sure  to  include  x-common-
    windows::maybe-pop-up-scroll-bar  in  the  new  list.)  restore-default-
    window-stream-method  restores  the  list to its initial contents BEFORE
    scrolling is enabled, so do not use that function if you want  scrolling
    on WSTREAM.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We make a window.
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 200
                              :width 100 :height 100
                              :activate-p t))
    ;;  The list contains one function.
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out *my-win*) =>
    (default-window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out-method)

    ;;  We enable extent scrolling on *MY-WIN*.
    ;;  This changes the list.
    (enable-window-stream-extent-scrolling *my-win*)
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out *my-win*)
      => (x-common-windows::maybe-pop-up-scroll-bar)

    ;;  We add another function to the list.
    (defun my-after-frame-mouse-cursor-out (wstream mouse-state event)
      (declare (ignore event))
          (format  *standard-output*
                   "Position: ~S ~% "
                   (mouse-state-position mouse-state)))

    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :frame-mouse-cursor-out
                                  :after 'my-after-frame-mouse-cursor-out)

    ;;  The list now contains two functions.
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out *my-win*)
      => (x-common-windows::maybe-pop-up-scroll-bar
              my-after-frame-mouse-cursor-out)

    ;;  We disable scrolling.  Our added function is lost.
    (disable-window-stream-extent-scrolling *my-win*)
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out-method)

    ;;  We add our function again.
    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :frame-mouse-cursor-out
                                  :after 'my-after-frame-mouse-cursor-out)
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out *my-win*) =>
    (default-window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out-method
              my-after-frame-mouse-cursor-out)

    ;;  Since scrolling is disabled, we can use
    ;;  RESTORE-DEFAULT-WINDOW-STREAM-METHOD to return
    ;;  to the initial state.
    (restore-default-window-stream-method *my-win*
      :frame-mouse-cursor-out)
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-out-method)
