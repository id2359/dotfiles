    FUNCTION
    window-stream-expand-notify  -  get the list of functions called by the
      expand-notify method

    Usage
    window-stream-expand-notify STREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the list of functions that will be called when the expand-notify
    method for the window-stream WSTREAM is called.  expand-notify is called
    by the system when a common window is expanded (from  an  icon)  by  the
    window  manager,  not  by  COMMON WINDOWS itself.  You do not (normally)
    call expand-notify directly.

    By default the list contains the single function  default-window-stream-
    expand-notify-method.   This  function  does the work of updating COMMON
    WINDOWS about the change in the window, so you should not remove it from
    the list.

    You can change this list by using modify-window-stream-method or replace
    it  entirely  by  using  setf.   If  you  replace the list, be sure that
    default-window-stream-expand-notify-method is in the new list.  You  can
    restore  the  list  to  its  initial  state with restore-default-window-
    stream-method.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win* (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
                                       :width 200 :height 200
                                       :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))
    (defun my-after-expand-notify (w)
      (format t "Status of window is ~S ~%" (window-stream-status w)))

    ;;  The initial list returned contains one function.
    (window-stream-expand-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-expand-notify-method)

    ;;  We add a new function.
    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :expand-notify
                                 :after 'my-after-expand-notify)
    ;;  Now the list contains two functions.
    (window-stream-expand-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-expand-notify-method my-after-expand-notify)

    ;;  We restore the list to its initial state.
    (restore-window-stream-method *my-win* :expand-notify)
    (window-stream-expand-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-expand-notify-method)
