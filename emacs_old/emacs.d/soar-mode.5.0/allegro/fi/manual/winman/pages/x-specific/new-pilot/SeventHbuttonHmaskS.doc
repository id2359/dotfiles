    VARIABLE
    *event-button-mask*  -  mask to determine which button went up or down

    DESCRIPTION
    Bound to a number which is the sum of  the  following  events,  each  of
    which is a constant bound to an integer
            *right-button-event*
            *middle-button-event*
            *left-button-event*

    This constant in included in COMMON WINDOWS as a convenience.  It  gives
    you a way of easily determining which of the above event types triggered
    the call to the mouse method you are dealing with.  (This is encoded  in
    the  TRANSITION  argument  to  the mouse method.) To determine the event
    type, use the function logand with *event-button-mask and the the  tran-
    sition  as  arguments.  If the result is eq to say, *left-button-event*,
    then you know that the left button is the one that triggered  the  mouse
    method.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;   Assume *m-e* is a mouse event argument
    ;;   passed to a mouse method.
    ;;  The following will return true if the event
    ;;  involved a button going down:
    (eq (logand *m-e* *event-button-mask*) *left-button-event*)
