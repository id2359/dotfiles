    FUNCTION
    window-stream-frame-color  -  get the color of the frame of a window-
      stream

    Usage
    window-stream-frame-color WSTREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the color of the frame of the window-stream WSTREAM.  The  frame
    includes  the  title area and the borders.  (The background of the title
    area will be in this color.  The title  itself  will  be  in  the  color
    returned by window-stream-title-color.)

    You can use setf and window-stream-frame-color to change the frame color
    and thus the value this function returns.

    EXAMPLES
    ;; We create a window and some colors.
    (setf *my-win*
            (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
            :width 200 :height 200
            :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))
    (setf *frame-color* (make-color-rgb :red .5 :green .5 :blue .5))
    (setf *title-color* (make-color :from-color black))

    ;;  Since it was not specified in MAKE-WINDOW-STREAM, the
    ;;  frame color is black.
    (window-stream-frame-color *my-win*)
      => #<color (rgb) 0.0 0.0 0.0: read-only>
    ;;  We change the color of the frame and the color of the title.
    (setf (window-stream-title-color *my-win*) *title-color*)
    (setf (window-stream-frame-color *my-win*) *frame-color*)
