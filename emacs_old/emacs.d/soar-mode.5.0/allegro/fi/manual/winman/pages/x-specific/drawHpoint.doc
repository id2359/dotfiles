    FUNCTION
    draw-point  -  draw a point on a graphic stream

    Usage
    draw-point GR-STREAM POSITION [:brush-width BRUSH-WIDTH] [:operation
      OPERATION] [:color COLOR]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A point is drawn on the graphic stream GR-STREAM at POSITION, which must
    be  a  position.  The position is given with respect to the extent coor-
    dinate system of GR-STREAM.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  For a function which passes the coordinates unbundled into
    their x and y components, see draw-point-xy.

    The keyword argument :brush-width is the width, in pixels, of the  point
    that  is  drawn.   This argument defaults to the value of window-stream-
    brush-width applied to GR-STREAM.  The  default  value  is  The  keyword
    argument  :operation  specifies  the boolean operation that will be used
    when the bits from the drawing operation are combined with the  bits  on
    the  graphic  stream.   This  argument  defaults to the value of window-
    stream-operation applied to GR-STREAM.  All the sixteen standard boolean
    operations  of  COMMON LISP are supported.  The keyword argument :color,
    specifies the drawing color, and  defaults  to  the  value  returned  by
    window-stream-foreground-color applied to GR-STREAM.

    The argument GR-STREAM may be either a window-stream  or  bitmap-stream.
    These  are  the  only  two types of graphic streams, with the difference
    between them being that  bitmap-streams  must  be  bitblted  to  window-
    streams.

    The function window-stream-draw-point returns the list of functions that
    this  method  calls.  You can change this list by using setf and window-
    stream-draw-point or  by  using  modify-window-stream-method.   You  can
    restore  the  list  to  its original default state with restore-default-
    window-stream-method.

    The draw-point method returns what is returned by the last  function  in
    the  list  of  functions called by the method. If this list has not been
    changed from its initial value, draw-point returns nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream
           :left 100
           :bottom 300
           :width 300
           :height 300
           :activate-p t))
    ;;  We draw a point in the center of the output region.
    (draw-point *my-win*
                (make-position :x 150 :y 150)
                :brush-width 2
                )
