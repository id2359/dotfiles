    FUNCTION
    draw-line  -  draw a line segment on a graphic stream

    Usage
    draw-line GR-STREAM POS1 POS2 [:brush-width BRUSH-WIDTH] [:color COLOR]
      [:dashing DASHING] [:operation OPERATION]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A line segment is drawn on the graphic stream  GR-STREAM  from  POS1  to
    POS2.   These  positions are given with respect to the extent coordinate
    system of GR-STREAM.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  For a function which passes the  position  data  structure
    unbundled into its x and y components, see draw-line-xy.

    The keyword argument :brush-width is the width, in pixels, of the points
    that  are drawn.  The default value is the value of window-stream-brush-
    width applied to gr-stream.  The keyword argument  :operation  specifies
    the  boolean  operation that will be used when the bits from the drawing
    operation are combined with the bits on the graphic stream.  This  argu-
    ment  defaults  to  the  value  of  window-stream-operation  applied  to
    GR-STREAM.  All the sixteen standard boolean operations of  COMMON  LISP
    are  supported.   The  keyword  argument  :color,  specifies the drawing
    color, and defaults to the value returned  by  window-stream-foreground-
    color applied to GR-STREAM.

    The keyword argument :dashing is a  list  which  specifies  the  dashing
    pattern  of  the  line.  For example, the dashing pattern (1 2 3 4) says
    that one bit should be turned on followed by 2 bits turned off  followed
    by  3 bits turned on followed by 4 bits turned off, and then the pattern
    repeated throughout the drawing operation.  If the length of the list is
    odd,  then  the  dashing  pattern  cycles.  For example the list (1 2 3)
    would produce the dashing pattern (1 on, 2 off, 3 on)  (1 off, 2  on,  3
    off),  etc.   If the length of the list is odd, then the dashing pattern
    cycles.  for the integer repeated twice in the  usual  list  representa-
    tion.  (1 on, 2 off, 3 on)  (1 off, 2 on,3 off), etc.  A dashing pattern
    that consists of a single integer is a shorthand for the list consisting
    of  the  pattern followed by the pattern.  For example, if DASHING is 2,
    then this is equivalent to the dashing pattern (2 2) .

    The argument GR-STREAM may be either a window-stream  or  bitmap-stream.
    These  are  the  only  two types of graphic streams, with the difference
    between them being that  bitmap-streams  must  be  bitblted  to  window-
    streams.

    The function window-stream-draw-line returns the list of functions  that
    this  method  calls.  You can change this list by using setf and window-
    stream-draw-line  or  by  using  modify-window-stream-method.   You  can
    restore  the  list  to  its original default state with restore-default-
    window-stream-method.

    The draw-line method returns what is returned by the  last  function  in
    the  list  of  functions called by the method. If this list has not been
    changed from its initial value, draw-line returns nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream
           :left 100
           :bottom 300
           :width 300
           :height 300
           :activate-p t))


    ;;  We draw to a point in the center of the output region.
    (draw-line *my-win*
                (make-position :x 150 :y 150)
                (make-position :x 200 :y 200)
                :brush-width 2
                )
