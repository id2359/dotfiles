    FUNCTION
    make-mouse-cursor  -  create a mouse cursor

    Usage
    make-mouse-cursor {[:source-index S-INDEX] [:source-font S-FONT] |
      [:source-bitmap S-BITMAP]} {[:mask-index M-INDEX] [:mask-font M-FONT]
      | [:mask-bitmap M-BITMAP]} [:x-hotspot X-HOTSPOT] [:y-hotspot Y-
      HOTSPOT] [:foreground-color FG-COLOR] [:background-color BG-COLOR]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a new mouse cursor.

    Mouse cursors are constructed with two bitmaps, one describing the  cur-
    sor  itself  and  one describing the mask.  (The cursor bitmap is called
    the `source' bitmap.) The mask outlines the cursor, ensuring that it  is
    visible  against  any  background.  Both bitmaps must have depth 1.  The
    cursor will be in the foreground color (the value  of  the  :foreground-
    color  argument, which defaults to black) where both the source and mask
    bitmaps are one.  The cursor will be in the background color (the  value
    of  the  :background-color argument, which defaults to white) everywhere
    the source bitmap is 0 and the  mask  bitmap  is  1.   The  cursor  only
    changes pixels on the screen where the mask bitmap is 1.

    To define a mouse cursor, therefore, you need two bitmaps the same size.
    (The height must lie between the values of *minimum-mouse-cursor-height*
    and  *maximum-mouse-cursor-height*  and  the  width  must  lie   between
    *minimum-mouse-cursor-width* and *maximum-mouse-cursor-width*.) You must
    specify the exact bit in these bitmaps which will be the  hotspot,  that
    is  the  true location of the cursor on the screen.  And you must decide
    on the foreground and background colors.

    There are two ways to specify these bitmaps.  You can construct your own
    and  specify  them  and  give  them  as the values of :source-bitmap and
    :mask-bitmap.  Or you can use predefined  bitmaps  available  in  the  X
    server.   These predefined bitmaps are stored in a font in the X server.
    The server font to use is specified with the :source-font and :mask-font
    indices.   The default value for both of these arguments is the value of
    *cursor-font*.  The value of these arguments  must  be  fonts,  such  as
    returned by open-font or open-font-named.

    You may examine the default font by entering xfd cursor

    to the shell.  A window displaying predefined cursors will appear,  each
    source  cursor followed immediately by its mask cursor.  Clicking middle
    over a cursor causes the index to be printed at the bottom of  the  win-
    dow.  If you are using this font, specify the index of the source as the
    value of :source-index and the index of the mask (typically one greater)
    as the value of mask-index.

    The x and y hotspots are predefined for these cursors  (in  the  display
    described  above, the cursors are displayed in a square with the hotspot
    in the middle of the square), so you do not  specify  values  for  those
    arguments  when  using  a  cursor from a font.  The foreground and back-
    ground colors are specified as described above.

    If you use your own bitmaps, specify them as the values of the  :source-
    bitmap  and  :mask-bitmap  arguments.  You must also specify the hotspot
    with the :x-hotspot and y-hotspot arguments.  The values of these  argu-
    ments  should be integers, the first between 0 and the width of the bit-
    map, the second between 0 and the height.  They specify the bit  in  the
    bitmap  which  will  be the hotspot.  The lower left corner is specified
    with both :x-hotspot and :y-hotspot 0.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq w (make-window-stream :activate-p t :title "My Window"))

    (setf (window-stream-mouse-cursor w)
      (make-mouse-cursor
       :foreground-color black
       :background-color white
       :source-index 4
       :mask-index 4
       ))
