    FUNCTION
    mouse-cursor-y-hotspot  -  the y-coordinate of a mouse cursor viewed as
      a single point

    Usage
    mouse-cursor-y-hotspot CURSOR

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the vertical  component  of  the  hotspot  of  the  mouse-cursor
    CURSOR.   The hotspot of a mouse cursor is the location, with respect to
    the bitmap of the mouse cursor, of the cursor when viewed  as  a  single
    point.   For  example, the hotspot might be at the tip of a mouse cursor
    that comes to a point.

    This accessor has meaning only when applied to mouse  cursors  that  are
    bitmaps, and not the predefined mouse cursors provided by X.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq w (make-window-stream :activate-p t :title "My Window"))
    (setq my-bitmap (make-bitmap :width 5 :height 5))
    (dotimes (i 5) (setf (bitmap-bit my-bitma i i) 1))
    (setf (window-stream-mouse-cursor w)
      (make-mouse-cursor
       :source-bitmap my-bitmap
       :x-hotspot 5
       :y-hotspot 5
       ))

    (mouse-cursor-y-hotspot (window-stream-mouse-cursor w))
