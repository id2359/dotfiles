    FUNCTION
    open-font-named  -  open a font of a given name

    Usage
    open-font-named SERVER-NAME

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the opened font.  SERVER-NAME must  be  a  string  denoting  the
    server  name  for  the  desired font.  The font need not be installed in
    COMMON WINDOWS before being opened  with  this  function.   Indeed  this
    function  is  designed  to  allow  you  to  avoid installing fonts (with
    install-font) entirely and to deal with fonts in  the  server  directly.
    However,  this  function does not check that such a font ACTUALLY exists
    in the server.  That check (and the associated  error  if  it  does  not
    exist) is done when the font is first used.

    Fonts are identified in X11 with unique server names.  These  names  are
    typically very long.  One such name, for example, is
    -adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1

    Since these names are unambiguous, using them allows you to get  exactly
    the  font  you  want.  (The associated function open-font, when can only
    open a font installed in COMMON WINDOWS,  will  return  a  font  approx-
    iamtely  equal  to  the  requested  one if the exact request font is not
    available.)

    EXAMPLES
    (open-font-named
      "-adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1")
      => #<Font :UNKNOWN :UNKNOWN :UNKNOWN, 0 point: uninitialized>
    ;;  Since OPEN-FONT-NAMED bypasses font installation, LISP
    ;;  doesn't know the characteristics of the font and so the
    ;;  structure fields are either unspecified or incorrect.  But
    ;;  as long as the server knows about the font, it will work
    ;;  correctly.  The function FONT-ATTRIBUTES will parse the
    ;;  server name and return information about the font.

    ;;  If you specify a server name which does not in fact
    ;;  refer to a font in the server, no error is signaled
    ;;  by OPEN-FONT-NAMED.
    (setq bad-font (open-font-named "foo"))
      => #<Font :UNKNOWN :UNKNOWN :UNKNOWN, 0 point: uninitialized>

    ::  The error is signaled when you try to use the font.
    (make-window-stream :font bad-font) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is: Error: Attempt to open unknown font....
