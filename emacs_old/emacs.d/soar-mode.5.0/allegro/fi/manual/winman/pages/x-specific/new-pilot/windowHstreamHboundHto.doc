    FUNCTION
    window-stream-bound-to  -  get the coordinate system used to position a
      window

    Usage
    window-stream-bound-to WSTREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns either :frame or :extent, depending on whether the window-stream
    WSTREAM is positioned in the physical or the extent coordinate system of
    its parent.

    A window can be positioned with respect to either the  physical  or  the
    extent  coordinate  system  of  its  parent.  If the positioning is with
    respect to the physical coordinate system, the window will not move when
    its parent is scrolled over its extent and the window will be visible as
    long as it is contained within the outer dimensions of the  parent  win-
    dow.   If  the positioning is with respect to the extent coordinate sys-
    tem, the window will move when the parent is scrolled and only that por-
    tion  contained in the parent's inner region will be visible.  Since the
    two coordinate systems are  the  same  for  the  *root-window*  and  the
    *root-window* cannot be scrolled, it makes no difference what coordinate
    system is used if the parent is the *root-window*.

    The coordinate system used  is  determined  when  the  window-stream  is
    created  with  make-window-stream.  The :bound-to argument to that func-
    tion takes values :extent (the default, indicating the  window  will  be
    positioned  in  the  extent coordinate system) or :frame (indicating the
    window will be positioned with respect to the physical  coordinate  sys-
    tem).  The value chosen is returned by this function.

    You may change the value returned with setf and  window-stream-bound-to.
    If you do so, the window will be repositioned to the location in the new
    coordinate system of  the  parent  specified  by  the  left  and  bottom
    (returned by window-stream-left and window-stream-bottom) of WSTREAM.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq parent-win
      (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100 :width 300 :height 300
                          :activate-p t :title "Parent"))

    (setf (window-stream-scrollable-p parent-win) t)

    ;;  We draw a circle in the parent window as a reference point.
    (setq child-win
      (make-window-stream :left 50 :bottom 50 :width 100 :height 100
                          :parent parent-win :activate-p t :title "Child"))

    (window-stream-bound-to child-win) => :extent
    ;; The child window scrolls with the extent.
    (scroll parent-win
            (make-region
             :left 100 :bottom 0 :width 300 :height 300))

    ;; Scroll to the original region.
    (scroll parent-win
            (make-region :left 0 :bottom 0 :width 300 :height 300))

    ;;  We change what CHILD-WIN is bound to.  CHILD-WIN may
    ;;  move when this is done.
    (setf (window-stream-bound-to child-win) :frame)

    ;;  Now CHILD-WIN will not move when PARENT-WIN is scrolled.
    (scroll parent-win
            (make-region
             :left 100 :bottom 0 :width 300 :height 300))
