    FUNCTION
    menu-field-triple-list  -  retrieve the field-triple-list of a menu
      structure

    Usage
    menu-field-triple-list MENU

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the field-triple-list component of MENU, which must be an object
    that satisfies menu-p.

    A field-triple-list is a specification of the choices and actions  of  a
    menu.   Each  item  in  a field-triple-list is a list of three elements.
    The first can either be a symbol or a string, and determines  what  will
    be  displayed for this menu item.  The second can either be a symbol, or
    a menu object that has been We created with pop-up-menu-choose.   If  it
    is a symbol, then pop-up-menu-choose will return it, unevaluated if this
    menu item is selected.  If it is a menu object, then  pop-up-menu-choose
    will  treat  it as a "walking menu" item.  The third element in a triple
    must be present, but is ignored by this implementation.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
            (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
            :width 200 :height 200
            :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (setf *my-menu*
          (make-pop-up-menu
           '(("Close" close "Close this window to an icon")
             ("Move" move "Select to move this window"))
           :title "My Menu"))

    ;;  We pop up the menu.
    (block nil
           (set-mouse-position
            (make-position :x 200 :y 200))
           (let ((selection
                  (pop-up-menu-choose *my-menu*)))
             (case selection (close (deactivate *my-win*))
                   (move (move *my-win* (get-position))))))

    ;;  We Look at the field-triple-list for this menu.
    (menu-field-triple-list *my-menu*)
      => (("Close" CLOSE "Close this window to an icon")
           ("Move" MOVE "Select to move this window"))
