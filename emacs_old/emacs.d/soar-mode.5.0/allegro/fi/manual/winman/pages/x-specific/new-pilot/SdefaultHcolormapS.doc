    VARIABLE
    *default-colormap*  -  the default LISP colormap

    DESCRIPTION
    A LISP colormap is a LISP data structure used to store colors.  On black
    and white machines, the colormap contains black and white and no further
    colors need be defined.  On gray level machines, grays can  be  defined.
    On color machines, many colors can be defined.

    One LISP colormap is defined when COMMON WINDOWS is initialized.  It  is
    the  default  LISP  colormap that is the value of this variable.  A LISP
    colormap is the interface between LISP colors and the  server  colormap.
    Each  LISP  colormap  is  associated  with a server colormap, and when a
    color is installed (stored) in a LISP colormap, it is assigned an  index
    into the associated server colormap and the color value is stored in the
    server colormap location specified by the index.

    The *default-colormap* is associated with the default  server  colormap,
    the  one  used  when  COMMON  WINDOWS is initialized.  As new colors are
    installed in the *default-colormap*, slots are grabbed from the  default
    server  colormap.  When no more slots are available, trying to install a
    new  color  will  signal  an  error.   (The  error  condition  will   be
    allocate-color-error.)

    Unless you need lots of colors, you need not use  LISP  colormaps  other
    than  the  default,  and  therefore,  since this colormap is the default
    value of every colormap argument, you need not worry about colormaps  at
    all.  Only if you need lots of colors or if you get an error when trying
    to install a color do you need to create a new colormap.  See the  entry
    on make-colormap for more information.

    The printed representation of the colormap structure  contains  informa-
    tion  about how many colors have been installed.  You will note only two
    colors are defined when COMMON WINDOWS is initialized.  New  colors  are
    installed as you use them.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  When Common Windows starts up:
    *default-colormap* => #<Default colormap @@ #x6f5e11, 2 slots in use>
    ;;  Colors are installed either when the are used:
    (make-window-stream :foreground-color blue)
    *default-colormap* => #<Default colormap @@ #x6f5e11, 3 slots in use>
    ;;  Or when they are installed explicitly.  Note that the
    ;;  optional second argument to INSTALL-COLOR defaults to
    ;;  the value of *DEFAULT-COLORMAP*.
    (install-color red)
    *default-colormap* => #<Default colormap @@ #x6f5e11, 4 slots in use>
