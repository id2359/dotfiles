    FUNCTION
    bitblt  -  transfer a bit pattern

    Usage
    bitblt SOURCE SOURCE-LFT SOURCE-BOT DEST DEST-LFT DEST-BOT [WIDTH
      [HEIGHT [OPERATION [CLIP-REGION [REPLICATE]]]]]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    get the bit values of SOURCE are combined with the bit values  on  DEST,
    using OPERATION, thereby destructively changing the bit values on DEST.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns, as multiple values, the width and height  of  that  portion  of
    SOURCE that was actually bitblted.

    Conceptually, that portion of SOURCE whose left and bottom are specified
    by  SOURCE-LFT  and  SOURCE-BOT, is laid over that portion of DEST whose
    left and bottom are specified by DEST-LFT and DEST-BOT.  A value of  (0,
    0) for the -LFT and -BOT arguments indicates the lower left hand corner.
    The objects SOURCE and DEST can each be either bitmaps,  bitmap-streams,
    or window-streams.  Only window-streams are viewable, however.

    The optional arguments WIDTH and HEIGHT default to the  values  for  the
    width  and height of the source image.  They may be used, in conjunction
    with SOURCE-LFT and SOURCE-BOT, to delimit any desired rectangular  area
    within  SOURCE.   The optional argument CLIP-REGION, is a region defined
    with respect to the extent coordinate system of DEST.  It acts like  the
    clipping  region  of  a  window-stream.  In other words, no bits on DEST
    will be affected outside of this  region.   A  value  of  nil  means  no
    restriction  comes  from  bitblt.   (The  clipping region of the window-
    stream itself affects the action of bitblt, of course.)

    The optional argument REPLICATE can be nil (the default) or non-nil.  If
    it  is  non-nil,  the argument DEST will be tiled with copies of SOURCE,
    until the clipping region (defined above)  is  completely  covered.   To
    tile  the  entire  viewable  portion  of the window, specify CLIP-REGION
    (which must be given a value when REPLICATE is specified) to be nil.

    Finally, the optional argument OPERATION may be used to specify the log-
    ical  operation  used for combining the bits.  All 16 boolean operations
    are supported.  The default is boole-1.  Note  that  boolean  operations
    associated  with  either  SOURCE  or  DEST  (such  as  a  window-stream-
    operation) are ignored by bitblt.  bitblt uses  either  boole-1  or  the
    operation specified as the value of the OPERATION argument.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We create a bitmap-stream.
    (setf *my-bitmap-stream*
          (make-bitmap-stream
           :width 51
           :height 51))

    ;;  We create a window.

    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream
           :left 0
           :width 200
           :bottom 100
           :height 200
           :activate-p t :title "Window #1"))

    (draw-line *my-win*
              (make-position :x 10 :y 10)
              (make-position :x 30 :y 40) :brush-width 1)

    ;;  We transfer *my-win* to *my-bitmap-stream*.

    (bitblt *my-win* 0 0 *my-bitmap-stream* 0 0)

    (clear *my-win*)

    ;;  now transfer the image back again

    (bitblt *my-bitmap-stream* 0 0 *my-win* 0 0)
