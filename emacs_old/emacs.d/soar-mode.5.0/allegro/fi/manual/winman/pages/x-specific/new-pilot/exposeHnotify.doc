    METHOD
    expose-notify  -  expose method called when X exposes a window

    Usage
    expose-notify WSTREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns   what   the   last   function   in   the   list   returned   by
    window-stream-expose-notify  returns.  When the X window-manager exposes
    a common window, it informs COMMON WINDOWS that it has done so to  allow
    COMMON  WINDOWS to update its information on window status.  COMMON WIN-
    DOWS calls this method, which in turn calls all the  functions  returned
    by  window-stream-expose-notify  applied  to  WSTREAM.  You do not (nor-
    mally) call this function directly.

    The initial value of the list  returned  by  window-stream-expose-notify
    contains the single function default-window-stream-expose-notify-method.
    This function does the work of updating COMMON WINDOWS so you should not
    remove  it from the list.  You may add new functions to the list for any
    window-stream with modify-window-stream-method.   You  may  replace  the
    whole  list  with  setf  and  window-stream-expose-notify but be sure to
    include default-window-stream-expose-notify-method in the new list.  The
    function  restore-default-window-stream-method  restores the list to its
    original value.

    Any function added to the list must accept one argument.   The  argument
    will be the window-stream WSTREAM.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
                (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
                :width 200 :height 200
                :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (window-stream-expose-notify *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-expose-notify-method)

    (defun my-after-expose-notify (w)
      (format wstream "I have been exposed ~%"))

    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :expose-notify
                           :after 'my-after-expose-notify)
    (window-stream-expose-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-expose-notify-method
              my-after-expose-notify)
