    FUNCTION
    draw-filled-circle-xy  -  draw a filled circle on a graphic stream

    Usage
    draw-filled-circle-xy GR-STREAM X Y RADIUS [:color COLOR] [:operation
      OPERATION]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A filled circle  of  radius  RADIUS  is  drawn  on  the  graphic  stream
    GR-STREAM, centered around the position determined by X and Y.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  The argument RADIUS must be an integer.  The  arguments  X
    and  Y  determine  the  x  and y coordinates of a POSITION in the extent
    coordinate system of GR-STREAM.  For a function which passes  the  posi-
    tion   data   structure   directly,   instead  of  its  components,  see
    draw-filled-circle.

    The keyword argument :operation specifies  the  boolean  operation  that
    will  be used when the bits from the drawing operation are combined with
    the bits on the graphic stream.  This argument defaults to the value  of
    window-stream-operation  applied to GR-STREAM.  All the sixteen standard
    boolean operations of COMMON LISP are supported.  The  keyword  argument
    :color,  specifies  the  drawing  color,  and if not specified, uses the
    color returned by window-stream-foreground-color.

    The argument GR-STREAM may be either a window-stream  or  bitmap-stream.
    These  are  the  only  two types of graphic streams, with the difference
    between them being that  bitmap-streams  must  be  bitblted  to  window-
    streams.

    The function window-stream-draw-filled-circle-xy  returns  the  list  of
    functions  that  this  method  calls.  You can change this list by using
    setf and window-stream-draw-filled-circle-xy or by using  modify-window-
    stream-method.   You  can restore the list to its original default state
    with restore-default-window-stream-method.

    The draw-filled-circle-xy method returns what is returned  by  the  last
    function in the list of functions called by the method. If this list has
    not been changed from its initial value,  draw-filled-circle-xy  returns
    nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
            (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
            :width 200 :height 200
            :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (draw-filled-circle-xy *my-win*
                           50  50
                           50)
