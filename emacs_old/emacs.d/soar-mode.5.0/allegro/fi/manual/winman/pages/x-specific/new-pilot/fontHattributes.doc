    FUNCTION
    font-attributes  -  get the attributes of a font

    Usage
    font-attributes FONT

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns an alist  which  lists  font  attributes  and  their  associated
    values.  FONT must be a font installed in COMMON WINDOWS.

    Each font in X has a unique server name associated with it.   This  name
    is very long.  It concatenates most information about a font, separating
    pieces of information with hyphens.  One such name is
    -adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1

    This name tells us that the foundry (the company that produced the font)
    is  Adobe;  the  family is Courier; the weight is medium; and so on (all
    the attributes are given in the example section).

    Note that fonts are stored in COMMON WINDOWS with another alist  set  up
    when the font is installed.  That alist, returned by installed-fonts, is
    not the same as this alist and, indeed, need not have  the  same  values
    for  attributes.   The  attributes  in the installed-fonts are specified
    when the font is installed.  The attributes in this list are parsed from
    the server name.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The *SYSTEM-FONT* may differ in your system.  We have
    ;;  placed comments describing the attributes before some
    ;;  entries. (Note: the server name contains no information
    ;;  for some attributes.)
    (font-attributes *system-font*) =>
    ;;  The compnay which produced the font:
    ((:foundry . "adobe")
    ;;  The name of the font:
    (:family . :courier)
    ;;  The thickness of the pen (:light, :bold, :medium, etc.):
    (:weight . :medium)
    ;;  The slant of the pen (roman is straight, italic is slanted
    ;;  right, etc:
    (:slant . :roman)
    ;;  How close the letters are together:
    (:setwidth-name . "normal")
    (:add-style-name)
    ;;  The actual size on the screen, in pixels:
    (:pixel-size . 12)
    ;;  The size (in tenths of points) the font was designed to
    ;;  be (a point is 1/72 of an inch:
    (:point-size . 120)
    ;;  The x-pixels-per-inch for which the font is designed:
    (:resolution-x . 75)
    ;;  The y-pixels-per-inch for which the font is designed:
    (:resolution-y . 75)
    ;;  The letter spacing (monospace: every letter has the
    ;;  same width; proportional: letters have different widths):
    (:spacing . :monospaced)
    ;;  The average width of a letter (in tenths of points):
    (:average-width . 70)
    (:font-name-registry)
    (:char-set-registry . "iso8859")
    (:char-set-encoding . "1")
    ;;  The unique server name:
    (:font-descriptor .
    "-adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1"))
