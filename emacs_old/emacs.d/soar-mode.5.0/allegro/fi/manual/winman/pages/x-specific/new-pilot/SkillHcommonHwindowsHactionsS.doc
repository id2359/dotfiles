    VARIABLE
    *kill-common-windows-actions*  -  list of functions called by kill-
      common-windows

    DESCRIPTION
    Bound to the list of functions that are called,  in  order,  when  kill-
    common-windows  is  called.   (Actually,  the  list contains the symbols
    which denote the functions, not the function  objects  themselves.)  The
    functions are called with no arguments.  itself takes no arguments.)

    The initial value of this variable is the  list  containing  the  single
    function  default-kill-common-windows.   This  function does the work of
    killing COMMON WINDOWS so it MUST be in the list.  You should add  other
    functions  with  push  or  append and remove them with remove.  (You may
    replace    the    entire    list,    of    course,    so     long     as
    default-kill-common-windows is included.)

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The default value of the list:
    *kill-common-windows-actions* => (default-kill-common-windows)
    ;;  We define another function and add it to the list:
    (defun my-res (&rest args) (declare (ignore args))
      (format t "Killing Common Windows Now.~%"))
    (push 'my-res *kill-common-windows-actions*)
    *kill-common-windows-actions*
      => (my-res default-kill-common-windows)

    SEE ALSO

    stream-actions*, *restart-common-windows-actions*
