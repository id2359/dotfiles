                                                           *event-type-mask*


    VARIABLE
    *event-type-mask*  -  mask to determine the type of a mouse event

    DESCRIPTION
    Bound to a number which is the sum of  the  following  events,  each  of
    which is a constant bound to an integer
            *button-down-event*
            *button-up-event*
            *mouse-cursor-in-event*
            *mouse-cursor-out-event*
            *mouse-moved-event*

    This constant in included in COMMON WINDOWS as a convenience.  It  gives
    you a way of easily determining which of the above event types triggered
    the call to the mouse method you are dealing with.  (This is encoded  in
    the  TRANSITION  argument  to  the mouse method.) To determine the event
    type, use the function logand with *event-type-mask and the the  transi-
    tion  as arguments.  If the result is eq to say, *button-up-event*, then
    you know that this is the type of the event.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;   Assume *m-e* is a mouse event argument
    ;;   passed to a mouse method.
    ;;  The following will return true if the event
    ;;  involved a button going down:
    (eq (logand *m-e* *event-type-mask*) *button-down-event*)
