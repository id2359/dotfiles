    FUNCTION
    common-windows-host  -  get the machine running the X server connected

    Usage
    common-windows-host

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns as a string the name of the server to which  COMMON  WINDOWS  is
    connected.   You  must be connected to a server in order to perform most
    operations in COMMON WINDOWS (e.g. making  a  window  with  make-window-
    stream).    This   connection   is  established  when  you  call  either
    initialize-common-windows or restart-common-windows.

    (kill-common-windows)
    (initialize-common-windows :host "frigg")
    (common-windows-host) => "frigg"
