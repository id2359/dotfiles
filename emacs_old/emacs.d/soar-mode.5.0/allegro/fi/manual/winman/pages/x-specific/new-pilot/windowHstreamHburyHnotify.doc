    FUNCTION
    window-stream-bury-notify  -  get the list of functions called by the
      bury-notify method

    Usage
    window-stream-bury-notify STREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the list of functions that will be called when  the  bury-notify
    method  for  the window-stream WSTREAM is called.  bury-notify is called
    by the system when a common window is buried by the window manager,  not
    by  COMMON  WINDOWS  itself.   You  do  not  (normally) call bury-notify
    directly.

    By default the list contains the single function  default-window-stream-
    bury-notify-method.  This function does the work of updating COMMON WIN-
    DOWS about the change in the window, so you should not  remove  it  from
    the list.

    You can change this list by using modify-window-stream-method or replace
    it  entirely  by  using  setf.   If  you  replace the list, be sure that
    default-window-stream-bury-notify-method is in the new  list.   You  can
    restore  the  list  to  its  initial  state with restore-default-window-
    stream-method.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win* (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
                                       :width 200 :height 200
                                       :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (defun my-after-bury-notify (w) (format wstream "I have been buried ~%"))

    ;;  The initial list returned contains one function.
    (window-stream-bury-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-bury-notify-method)

    ;;  We add a new function and check the list again..
    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :bury-notify
                                 :after 'my-after-bury-notify)
    (window-stream-bury-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-bury-notify-method my-after-bury-notify)

    ;;  We restore the list to its initial state.
    (restore-window-stream-method *my-win* :bury-notify)
    (window-stream-bury-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-bury-notify-method)
