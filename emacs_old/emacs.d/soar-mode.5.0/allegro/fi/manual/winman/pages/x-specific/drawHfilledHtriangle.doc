    FUNCTION
    draw-filled-triangle  -  draw a filled triangle on a graphic stream

    Usage
    draw-filled-triangle GR-STREAM POS1 POS2 POS3 [:color COLOR] [:operation
      OPERATION]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A filled triangle, determined by the given positions, is  drawn  on  the
    graphic  stream  GR-STREAM.   which  must be either a window-stream or a
    bitmap-stream.  The three  vertices  of  the  triangle  are  the  points
    (X1,Y1),  (X2,Y2),  (X3,Y3)  which  are  the :x and :y components of the
    positions POS1, POS2, and POS3.  The triangle is filled with  the  color
    specified  by  the  value  of  the :color keyword argument, or the value
    returned by window-stream-foreground-color.

    Not all edges of a filled triangle are drawn.  (Thus a  filled  triangle
    is  NOT  just  an  ordinary  triangle filled in.) If the interior of the
    triangle lies to the left of the edge, the edge will  not  be  drawn.  A
    horizontal  edge which lies above the interior of the triangle rectangle
    will not be drawn.  Vertices are only drawn when both adjacent edges are
    drawn.   Leaving  edges out in this way allows a window to be tiled with
    the triangle without double covering of edges.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  The arguments POS1, POS2, and POS3 must all be  positions.
    All  coordinates  are  give  respect  to the extent coordinate system of
    GR-STREAM.  For a function which specifies the coordinates of the trian-
    gle in terms of coordinate values, use draw-filled-triangle-xy.  for

    The keyword argument :operation specifies  the  boolean  operation  that
    will  be used when the bits from the drawing operation are combined with
    the bits on the graphic stream.  This argument defaults to the value  of
    window-stream-operation  applied to GR-STREAM.  All the sixteen standard
    boolean operations of COMMON LISP are supported.  The  keyword  argument
    :color,  specifies  the  drawing  color,  and if not specified, uses the
    color returned by window-stream-foreground-color.

    The argument GR-STREAM may be either a window-stream  or  bitmap-stream.
    These  are  the  only  two types of graphic streams, with the difference
    between them being that  bitmap-streams  must  be  bitblted  to  window-
    streams.

    Note that draw-filled-triangle, and  all  the  related  triangle-drawing
    functions,  are  not methods.  This makes them different from all of the
    other drawing functions, which are  currently  implemented  as  methods.
    The draw-triangle family CANNOT be customized for each graphics stream.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
            (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
            :width 200 :height 200
            :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (draw-filled-triangle *my-win*
                          (make-position :x 10 :y 10)
                          (make-position :x 100 :y 100)
                          (make-position :x 25 :y 75))
