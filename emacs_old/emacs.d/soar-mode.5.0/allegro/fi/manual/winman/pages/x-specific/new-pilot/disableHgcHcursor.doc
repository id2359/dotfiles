    FUNCTION
    disable-gc-cursor  -  turn off the gc-cursor

    Usage
    disable-gc-cursor

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The gc-cursor will NOT be displayed when the  a  garbage  collection  is
    taking place.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns an integer (whose value is  undetermined  and  has  no  signifi-
    cance), but this function is called for its side effects.  The gc-cursor
    (which, when enabled, is displayed when LISP is garbage  collecting)  is
    disabled.   After this function returns, the cursor will not change dur-
    ing a gc.

    The function enable-gc-cursor turns on the gc-cursor.  The gc-cursor can
    also be enabled with initialize-common-windows.

    EXAMPLES
    ;; Turn on the gc-cursor.
    (enable-gc-cursor)
    ;;  Force a gc.  The hourglass cursor will be
    ;;  displayed during the gc.
    (gc t)
    ;; Turn off the gc-cursor.
    (disable-gc-cursor)
