    FUNCTION
    window-stream-frame-middle-button-down  -  get the list of functions
      called by the frame-middle-button-down method

    Usage
    window-stream-frame-middle-button-down WSTREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the list of functions  that  will  be  called  when  the  frame-
    middle-button-down  method for the window-stream WSTREAM is called.  The
    system calls this method when the middle  button  is  depressed  in  the
    frame of a window.  You do not (normally) call this method directly.

    The initial contents of this list depends of whether  the  right  button
    menu  is  installed  on WSTREAM.  (The function add-right-button-menu is
    the only function initially in  the  *make-window-stream-actions*  list.
    If that list is in its initial state when a window is created, the right
    button menu will be installed on the window.) If it is,  the  list  con-
    tains  the single function cw::window-frame-middle-down (note this func-
    tion is not exported, so the package qualifier and the double colon  are
    both necessary).  This function calls the interactive move method on the
    window (as depressing the middle button in the frame is supposed  to  do
    when  the  right button menu is installed).  If you modify the list, you
    must include this function if you want the middle  button  to  move  the
    window.   If  the  right  button menu is not installed, the initial list
    contains the single  function  frame-button,  calling  the  frame-button
    method.

    You can modify  the  list  with  modify-window-stream-method.   You  can
    replace  the  entire  list  with  this function and setf (remembering to
    include  cw::window-frame-middle-down   if   desired).    The   function
    restore-default-window-stream-method  can be used to restore the list to
    the value (frame-button), NOT (cw::window-frame-middle-down).

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We make a window.
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 200
                              :width 100 :height 100
                              :activate-p t))

    ;;  We assume *MAKE-WINDOW-STREAM-ACTIONS* is in its
    ;;  initial state, so CW::WINDOW-FRAME-LEFT-DOWN is in
    ;;  The list of functions.
    (window-steam-frame-middle-button-down *my-win*)
      => (cw::window-frame-middle-down)

    (defun my-after-frame-middle (wstream mouse-state event)
      (declare (ignore event))
          (format  *standard-output*
                   "Position: ~S ~% "
                   (mouse-state-position mouse-state)))

    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :frame-middle-button-down
                                  :after 'my-after-frame-button)
    ;;  Whenever the middle button is depressed in *MY-WIN*, the
    ;;  position is printed to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.

    (window-stream-frame-middle-button-down *my-win*)
      => (cw::window-stream-middle-down my-after-frame-button)

    ;;  If we restore the list with RESTORE-WINDOW-STREAM-METHOD,
    ;;  the list contains FRAME-BUTTON only.
    (restore-window-stream-method *my-win* :frame-middle-button-down)
    (window-stream-frame-middle-button-down *my-win*)
      => (frame-button)

    ;;  If you want CW::WINDOW-STREAM-LEFT-DOWN to be in the
    ;;  list, use SETF to restore the list.
    (setf (window-stream-frame-middle-button-down *my-win*)
      '(cw::window-frame-middle-down))
    (window-steam-frame-middle-button-down *my-win*)
      => (cw::window-frame-middle-down)
