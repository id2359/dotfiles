    FUNCTION
    conjugate  -  get the complex conjugate of a number, matrix, or vector

    Usage
    conjugate X

    DESCRIPTION
    This standard Common Lisp function has been modified  to  accept  matrix
    and  vector  as well as scalar arguments.  When the argument is a scalar
    (i.e. a number), this function works just as when Allegro Matrix is  not
    loaded: returning the complex conjugate of its argument.  When the argu-
    ment is a vector or a matrix, a new vector or matrix  is  returned  each
    element  of  which is the complex conjugate of the corresponding element
    of the argument vector or matrix.

    Recall that the complex conjugate of the complex number  a+bi  is  a-bi.
    Conjugation is an identity operation for non-complex numbers, so if X is
    a real number, it is returned.  If X is a real vector or matrix, a  copy
    of  it is returned.  The function nconjugate is a destructive version of
    conjugate that works on matrices and vectors only.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Our examples deal with matrices and vectors only.
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.0 #c(1.0 2.0)) (#c(3.0 -4.0) 7.0))))
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      1.0          #c(1.0 2.0)
      #c(3.0 -4.0) 7.0
    (setq mat1 (conjugate mat))
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
      1.0          #c(1.0 -2.0)
      #c(3.0 4.0)  7.0
    (setq vec (make-array 2 :initial-contents
                             '(#c(1.0 1.0) #c(2.0 -2.0))))
      => #(#c(1.0 1.0) #c(2.0 -2.0))
    (conjugate vec) => #(#c(1.0 -1.0) #c(2.0 2.0))
