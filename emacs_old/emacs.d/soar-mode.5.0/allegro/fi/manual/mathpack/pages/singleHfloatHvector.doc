    FUNCTION
    single-float-vector  -  Coerce all vector elements to be single-floats

    USAGE
    single-float-vector vector

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  a  new  vector  whose  array  element  type  (as  returned   by
    array-element-type)  is single-float and whose elements are the elements
    of VECTOR coerced to be single-floats.

    Some functions, such as inverse and determinant only operate on matrices
    whose  array element type is one of single-float, double-float, (complex
    single-float), or (complex double-float).  Although these  functions  do
    not  take  vector  arguments,  the  result  of some operations involving
    matrices and vectors (for example, diagonal-matrix, row-matrix,  *,  and
    others)  have  an  element type which is the most general of the element
    types of the arguments, so it is often useful to have all  matrices  and
    vectors  have the same element type.  Vectors can, of course, be created
    with any element type (or even t).  Applying this function to  a  vector
    produces  a  vector  suitable for passing to those functions.  Note that
    VECTOR itself is unaffected by this function.  The returned vector  does
    not share any storage with VECTOR.

    It is an error if any element  of  VECTOR  cannot  be  coerced  to  type
    single-float.   In  particular, no entry in VECTOR may be complex.  Some
    double-floats and bignums also cannot be coerced to be single floats.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq vec (make-array 4 :initial-contents '(1 1/2 3.0 3.0d0)))
      => #(1 1/2 3.0 3.0d0)
    (array-element-type vec) => t
    (setq vec1 (single-float-vector vec))
      => #(1.0 0.5 3.0 3.0)
    (array-element-type vec1) => single-float

    (single-float-vector
       (make-array 1 :initial-contents '(#c(1.0 2.0)))) => ERROR
    ;;  The complex entry cannot be coerced to type SINGLE-FLOAT.
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: illegal argument to float: #c(1.0 2.0)
    ;;  Note that the error is in FLOAT, not SINGLE-FLOAT-VECTOR.
