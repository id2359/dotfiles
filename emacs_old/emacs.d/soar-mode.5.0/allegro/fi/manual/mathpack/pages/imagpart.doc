    FUNCTION
    imagpart  -  get the imaginary part of a number, matrix, or vector

    Usage
    imagpart X

    DESCRIPTION
    This standard Common Lisp function has been modified  to  accept  matrix
    and  vector  as well as scalar arguments.  When the argument is a scalar
    (i.e. a number), this function works just as when Allegro Matrix is  not
    loaded: returning the imaginary part of its argument.  When the argument
    is a vector or a matrix, a new vector or matrix is returned each element
    of which is the imaginary part of the corresponding element of the argu-
    ment vector or matrix.

    Recall that the complex number is a number of the form a+bi, where a and
    b  are  real  numbers.  The imaginary part of such a number is b.  (Note
    that the imaginary part is a real number.) The imaginary part of a  real
    number is zero (in the correct numeric format).

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Our examples deal with matrices and vectors only.
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.0 #c(1.0 2.0)) (#c(3.0 -4.0) 7.0))))
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      1.0          #c(1.0 2.0)
      #c(3.0 -4.0) 7.0
    (setq mat1 (imagpart mat))
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
      0.0  2.0
      -4.0 0.0
    (setq vec (make-array 2 :initial-contents
                             '(#c(1.0 1.0) #c(2.0 -2.0))))
      => #(#c(1.0 1.0) #c(2.0 -2.0))
    (imagpart vec) => #(1.0 -2.0)
