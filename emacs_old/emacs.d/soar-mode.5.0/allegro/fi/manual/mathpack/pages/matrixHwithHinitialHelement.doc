    FUNCTION
    matrix-with-initial-element  -  get a matrix with elements a specified
      value

    USAGE
    matrix-with-initial-element element dimensions

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a matrix of size specified by DIMENSIONS all of  whose  elements
    are  equal  to  ELEMENT.   DIMENSIONS may by an integer or a list of two
    integers.  If it is an integer, the resulting matrix will be square with
    that  number  of rows and columns.  If it is a list of two integers, the
    first specifies the number of rows and the second the number of  columns
    of  the  result  matrix.  ELEMENT must be a number.  The element type of
    the resulting matrix will be the type of ELEMENT.

    It is an error if ELEMENT is not a number or if DIMENSIONS is not a fix-
    num or a list of two fixnums.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat1 (matrix-with-initial-element -1.0 3))
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
      -1.0 -1.0 -1.0
      -1.0 -1.0 -1.0
      -1.0 -1.0 -1.0
    (array-element-type mat1) => single-float
    (setq mat2 (matrix-with-initial-element 5 '(2 4)))
    (print-matrix mat2) PRINTS
      5 5 5 5
      5 5 5 5
    (array-element-type mat2) => fixnum
