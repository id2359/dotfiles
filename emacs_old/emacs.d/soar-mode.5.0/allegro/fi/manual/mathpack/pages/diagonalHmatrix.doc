    FUNCTION
    diagonal-matrix  -  get a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are
      the elements in a vector

    USAGE
    diagonal-matrix vector

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a square matrix whose on-diagonal elements are the  elements  of
    VECTOR and whose off diagonal elements are zero.  If the element type of
    VECTOR is more specific than t, the off-diagonal zeroes  of  the  result
    matrix  will  be coerced to be the same type as the vector elements.  If
    the element type of VECTOR is t,  the  off  diagonal  elements  will  be
    integer  zeroes.   The  order  of  the  returned matrix is the length of
    VECTOR.  (That is, if the length of VECTOR is N, an NXN matrix  will  be
    returned).

    The element type (as  returned  by  array-element-type)  of  the  result
    matrix is the same as the element type of the argument VECTOR.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq vec1 (make-array 3 :initial-contents '(1.0 2.0 3.0)
                             :element-type 'single-float))
    (print-matrix (diagonal-matrix vec1)) PRINTS
      1.0 0.0 0.0
      0.0 2.0 0.0
      0.0 0.0 3.0

    (setq vec2 (make-array 3 :initial-contents '(1.0 2.0d0 #c(3.0 0.0))))
    (print-matrix (diagonal-matrix vec2)) PRINTS
      1.0         0           0
      0           2.0d0       0
      0           0           #c(3.0 0.0)
