    FUNCTION
    column  -  get a vector equal to a column of a matrix

    USAGE
    column matrix i

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a vector whose length is the same  as  the  number  of  rows  of
    MATRIX  and  whose  elements  are the same as those of the ITH column of
    MATRIX.  Indexing is zero-origin, so the first column is  referenced  by
    setting  I  to  zero.   The  returned vector will not share storage with
    MATRIX.

    Note that there is no :displaced argument as there is with the  function
    row.   This is because matrices are stored row-wise (the first row, then
    the second, etc.) so  column  elements  (except  in  certain  degenerate
    cases) are not contiguous in memory.

    The element type (as returned by array-element-type) of the result  vec-
    tor is the same as the element type of the argument MATRIX.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.1 1.2 1.3) (2.1 2.2 2.3) (3.1 3.2 3.3))
                           'single-float))
      => #2a((1.1 1.2 1.3) (2.1 2.2 2.3) (3.1 3.2 3.3))
    (column mat 0) => #(1.1 2.1 3.1)
    (column mat 1) => #(1.2 2.2 3.2)
    (column mat 2) => #(1.3 2.3 3.3)
    (column mat 3) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Not that many columns in matrix given to column
