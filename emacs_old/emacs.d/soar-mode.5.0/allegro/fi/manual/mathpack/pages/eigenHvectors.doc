    FUNCTION
    eigen-vectors  -  get the eigenvectors of a square matrix

    USAGE
    eigen-vectors matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a matrix (always complex, single or double  float  according  to
    the  type  of  MATRIX)  containing the eigenvectors of MATRIX, stored as
    rows.  MATRIX must be a square matrix whose element type (as returned by
    array-element-type)  is  one  of  single-float,  double-float,  (complex
    single-float), or (complex double-float).  It is an error if the  matrix
    does not have one of those element types.

    The returned matrix will have the same dimensions as MATRIX.  If for any
    reason the eigenvectors cannot be calculated, an error is signaled.

    Note that this function works by calling the function eigen and discard-
    ing  the  first  returned value, which is the vector of eigenvalues.  If
    you need both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, use  eigen  rather  than
    this function and eigen-values.
