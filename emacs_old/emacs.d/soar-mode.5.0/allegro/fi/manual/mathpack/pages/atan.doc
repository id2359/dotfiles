    FUNCTION
    atan  -  get the arc tangent of a number or matrix

    Usage
    atan X

    DESCRIPTION
    This standard Common Lisp function has been modified to accept matrix as
    well  as  scalar  arguments.   When  the  argument  is  a scalar (i.e. a
    number), this function works just as when Allegro Matrix is not  loaded:
    returning  the  arc  tangent  of  the  specified value in an appropriate
    numerical format.  When given a square matrix whose array  element  type
    is  one  of single-float, double-float, (complex single-float), (complex
    double-float), the matrix which is the atan of the matrix X is returned.
    The  atan  of  a  matrix is defined below.  It is an error if X is not a
    number or a matrix.  If X is a matrix, it  is  an  error  if  X  is  not
    square,  if  it  has  an  array  element type other than the four listed
    above, or if its atan cannot  be  calculated  for  any  reason  (usually
    because the matrix cannot be inverted).

    The atan (or any such function applied to a  matrix)  is  calculated  as
    follows.   A transformation matrix T and its inverse , T-inv, are calcu-
    lated such that T-inv*x*T is diagonal (that is, the  off  diagonal  ele-
    ments  are zero). T is the matrix of eigen vectors where the vectors are
    the columns of the matrix.  The function eigen-vectors returns a  matrix
    whose  rows  are  the  eigen  vectors, so T is the result of (ntranspose
    (eigen-vectors x)).  The diagonal elements  of  T-inv*x*T  are  replaced
    with  their  atan  and  the modified diagonal matrix is retransformed by
    multiplying on the left by T and on the right by T-inv.   Note  that  NO
    checking  is  done  to  ensure  that the diagonalized matrix is actually
    diagonal (that is, that the off-diagonal elements are  zero  to  machine
    accuracy).   Only if the diagonalization process actually fails will any
    error be signaled.  Note further that there may be more than one  possi-
    ble  result  (because of branch cuts, etc.), but only one result matrix,
    calculated as described, is returned.

    The returned matrix is of the same type as  the  argument  matrix.   The
    internal calculations are done as complex double-floats.  If X is a real
    matrix, it diagonalized counterpart is also real  (by  theory),  so  any
    imaginary  part  is  discarded. (atan applied to a real returns a real.)
    Then the values are coerced to single or double floats, as appropriate.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We only show ATAN applied to matrices here:
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0) (-3.0 4.0))))
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      1.0  2.0
      -3.0 4.0

    ;;  ATAN will not work on a matrix whose element type is T:
    (atan mat) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Non-float matrix to function computed by diagonalization

    ;;  Now we set the element type of the matrix passed to ATAN:
    (print-matrix (atan (single-float-matrix mat))) PRINTS
      1.1747884   0.18994495
      -0.28491744 1.4597058
