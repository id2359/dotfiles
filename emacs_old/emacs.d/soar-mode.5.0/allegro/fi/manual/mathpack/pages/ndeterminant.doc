    FUNCTION
    ndeterminant  -  destructively get the determinant of a square matrix

    USAGE
    ndeterminant matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns as multiple values the determinant of MATRIX and its  reciprocal
    condition  number,  which  is defined below.  MATRIX is modified by this
    function.  MATRIX  must  be  a  square  matrix  whose  element-type  (as
    returned  by  array-element-type)  is one of single-float, double-float,
    (complex single-float), or (complex double-float).  (Generally, the type
    should  be specified when the matrix is created, either with make-matrix
    or make-array.  Matrices returned by the functions  single-float-matrix,
    double-float-matrix,           complex-single-float-matrix,           or
    complex-double-float-matrix also have element types appropriate for this
    function.)  It  is an error if MATRIX is not square or does not have its
    element type listed above.  (Note that even if all elements are in  fact
    of  a  single,  appropriate type, this function will not work unless the
    element type is also correct).  This function destructively modifies its
    argument.  The related function determinant does not modify its argument
    while calculating its determinant.

    About half the work in calculating the determinant of a matrix  is  also
    necessary  in  calculating its inverse.  If you also need the inverse of
    MATRIX, we suggest that you call the function  ndeterminant-and-inverse,
    rather than inverse and this function individually.

    The RECIPROCAL CONDITION NUMBER is described in detail in section 1.4 of
    the  LINPACK  USERS'  GUIDE.  Briefly, there is a way to modify the ele-
    ments of the matrix by amounts less than the reciprocal condition number
    so  that  the  changed matrix is singular.  Therefore, if this number is
    smaller than the accuracy of the elements of your matrix,  some  results
    are  numerically  meaningless  since  the  matrix  cannot be numerically
    distinguished from a singular matrix.  If this value is  less  than  the
    Common  Lisp  constant  single-float-epsilon, if the matrix elements are
    single floats, or  double-float-epsilon,  if  the  elements  are  double
    floats,  attempts to calculate either the inverse or the eigen values or
    vectors will fail.  The determinant of a matrix singular to machine pre-
    cision  is assumed to be zero.  That value is returned regardless of the
    values of the elements of the matrix.

    EXAMPLES
    (print-matrix
      (setq r-mat (make-matrix '((2.0 3.0) (5.0 8.0))
                                'single-float))) PRINTS
      2.0 3.0
      5.0 8.0
    (ndeterminant r-mat) => 1.0000005 0.0081448
    ;;  The true value is 1.0.  5.0s-7 is within machine accuracy.
    ;;  The value of R-MAT is now changed:
    (print-matrix r-mat) PRINTS
      3.0        -0.6666667
      8.0        -0.3333335

    ;;  In the following, we do not specify the element type
    ;;  and we get an error when we apply determinant:
    (print-matrix
      (setq m-mat (make-matrix '((-3.0 4.0) (-5.0 7.0))))) PRINTS
      -3.0 4.0
      -5.0 7.0
    (ndeterminant m-mat) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Can't take determinant of anything
    ;;  except a floating-point matrix
    ;;  NDETERMINANT will work if we first apply SINGLE-FLOAT-MATRIX:
    (ndeterminant (single-float-matrix m-mat)) =>
      -1.0
      0.008558559
