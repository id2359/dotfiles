    FUNCTION
    realpart  -  get the imaginary part of a number, matrix, or vector

    Usage
    realpart X

    DESCRIPTION
    This standard Common Lisp function has been modified  to  accept  matrix
    and  vector  as well as scalar arguments.  When the argument is a scalar
    (i.e. a number), this function works just as when Allegro Matrix is  not
    loaded: returning the real part of its argument.  When the argument is a
    vector or a matrix, a new vector or matrix is returned each  element  of
    which is the real part of the corresponding element of the argument vec-
    tor or matrix.

    Recall that the complex number is a number of the form a+bi, where a and
    b are real numbers.  The real part of such a number is a.  The real part
    of a real number is that number.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Our examples deal with matrices and vectors only.
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.0 #c(1.0 2.0)) (#c(3.0 -4.0) 7.0))))
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      1.0          #c(1.0 2.0)
      #c(3.0 -4.0) 7.0
    (setq mat1 (realpart mat))
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
      1.0 1.0
      3.0 7.0
    (setq vec (make-array 2 :initial-contents
                             '(#c(1.0 1.0) #c(2.0 -2.0))))
      => #(#c(1.0 1.0) #c(2.0 -2.0))
    (realpart vec) => #(1.0 2.0)
