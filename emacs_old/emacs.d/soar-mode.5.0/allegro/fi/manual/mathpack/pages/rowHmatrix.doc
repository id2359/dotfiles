    FUNCTION
    row-matrix  -  get the row matrix from a vector

    USAGE
    row-matrix vector [:displaced dp]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a row (1XN) matrix whose elements are the elements of the vector
    VECTOR.   If  the  value  of  :displaced  keyword  argument  is nil (the
    default), the matrix will copy the values in the vector but  the  vector
    and  the  returned  matrix  will not share storage.  If the value of the
    :displaced argument is non-nil, the matrix will be  displaced  into  the
    vector.   The  difference  between  the  two cases is illustrated in the
    examples below.

    The element type (as  returned  by  array-element-type)  of  the  result
    matrix is the same as the element type of the argument VECTOR.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We make a vector with MAKE-ARRAY.
    ;;
    (setq vec (make-array 6 :initial-contents '(1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0)
                            :element-type 'single-float))
      => #(1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0)
    (setq mat1 (row-matrix vec))
      => #2a((1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0))
    (setq mat2 (row-matrix vec :displaced t))
      => #2a((1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0))
    ;;
    ;;  Note that when we change the first entry of VEC, MAT1
    ;;  is not affected but MAT2 (which was created with :DISPLACED
    ;;  non-NIL) is changed.
    ;;
    (setf (aref vec 0) 11.1)
    vec => #(11.1 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0)
    mat1 => #2a((1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0))
    mat2 => #2a((11.1 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0))
