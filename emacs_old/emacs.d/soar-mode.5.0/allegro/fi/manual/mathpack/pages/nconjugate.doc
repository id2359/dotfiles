    FUNCTION
    nconjugate  -  destructively replace a matrix or vector with its conju-
      gate

    USAGE
    nconjugate x

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns X, which must be a matrix or vector, after each entry  has  been
    replaced with its complex conjugate.  (Recall that the complex conjugate
    of a+bi is a-bi.) If X is a  real  matrix  or  vector,  it  is  returned
    unchanged.  If X has complex elements, they are replaced by their conju-
    gates.

    It is an error if X is not a matrix or vector.  (In particular, X cannot
    be  a  number.   The related function conjugate accepts numbers as argu-
    ments as well as matrices and vectors.)

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat1 (make-matrix '((#c(1.0 2.0) #c(-3.0 0.0) #c(4.0 -1.0)))))
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
      #c(1.0 2.0)  #c(-3.0 0.0) #c(4.0 -1.0)
    (print-matrix (nconjugate mat1)) PRINTS
      #c(1.0 -2.0)  #c(-3.0 0.0)  #c(4.0 1.0)
    ;;  MAT1 is now changed:
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
      #c(1.0 -2.0)  #c(-3.0 0.0)  #c(4.0 1.0)
    ;;  NCONJUGATE works on vectors too.
    (setq vec (make-array 2 :initial-contents '(1.0 #c(1.0 2.0))))
      => #(1.0 #c(1.0 2.0))
    (nconjugate vec) => #(1.0 #c(1.0 -2.0))
    ;;  VEC is now changed:
    vec => #(1.0 #c(1.0 -2.0))
