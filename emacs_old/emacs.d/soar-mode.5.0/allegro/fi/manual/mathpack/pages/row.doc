    FUNCTION
    row  -  get a vector equal to a row of a matrix

    USAGE
    row matrix i [:displaced dp]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a vector whose length is the same as the number  of  columns  of
    MATRIX  and  whose  elements  are  the  same  as those of the ITH row of
    MATRIX.  If the value of the :displaced keyword argument is non-nil, the
    returned  vector will be displaced into (share storage with) MATRIX.  An
    example below shows the effect of sharing storage.  If the value of  the
    :displaced  argument  is  nil  (the  default), the vector will not share
    storage with MATRIX.

    The element type (as returned by array-element-type) of the result  vec-
    tor is the same as the element type of the argument MATRIX.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.1 1.2 1.3) (2.1 2.2 2.3) (3.1 3.2 3.3))
                           'single-float))
      => #2a((1.1 1.2 1.3) (2.1 2.2 2.3) (3.1 3.2 3.3))
    (row mat 0) => #(1.1 1.2 1.3)
    (row mat 1) => #(2.1 2.2 2.3)
    (row mat 2) => #(3.1 3.2 3.3)
    (row mat 3) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Not that many rows in matrix given to row

    ;;  When the :DISPLACED argument is specified non-NIL,
    ;;  the matrix and the vector will share storage.
    (setq row0 (row mat 0)) => #(1.1 1.2 1.3)
    (setq row0d (row mat 0 :displaced t)) => #(1.1 1.2 1.3)
    ;;
    ;;  Now a change to MAT will also change ROW0D but not ROW0:
    (setf (aref mat 0 0) -1.1)
    mat => #2a((-1.1 1.2 1.3) (2.1 2.2 2.3) (3.1 3.2 3.3))
    row0 => #(1.1 1.2 1.3)
    row0d => #(-1.1 1.2 1.3)
