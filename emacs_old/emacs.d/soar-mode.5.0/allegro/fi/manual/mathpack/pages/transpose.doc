    FUNCTION
    transpose  -  get the transpose of a matrix

    USAGE
    transpose matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a new matrix which is the transpose of MATRIX.  The transpose of
    an  NXM  is a MXN matrix whose I,JTH element is the J,ITH element of the
    original matrix.  The argument MATRIX is unchanged by this function  and
    the  returned (transposed) matrix does not share any space with the ori-
    ginal matrix.  The related function ntranspose destructively replaces  a
    square  matrix  with  its  transpose.  It is an error if MATRIX is not a
    matrix.  In particular, it is an error to try to transpose a vector.

    The element type (as  returned  by  array-element-type)  of  the  result
    matrix is the same as the element type of the argument MATRIX.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat1 (make-matrix '((#c(1.0 2.0) #c(1.3 -4.6))
                              (#c(-2.0 1.7) #c(-6.4 -5.5)))))

    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
       #c(1.0 2.0)   #c(1.3 -4.6)
       #c(-2.0 1.7)  #c(-6.4 -5.5)

    (print-matrix (transpose mat1)) PRINTS
       #c(1.0  2.0)  #c(-2.0 1.7)
       #c(1.3 -4.6)  #c(-6.4 -5.5)

    (setq mat2 (make-matrix '((1.0 1.3) (2.2 4.6))))
    (print-matrix mat2) PRINTS
       1.0 1.3
       2.2 4.6
    (print-matrix (transpose mat2)) PRINTS
       1.0 2.2
       1.3 4.6

    (setq mat3 (make-matrix '((1 #c(5.0 2.0) 1/2 3.0))))
    (print-matrix mat3) PRINTS
       1           #c(5.0 2.0) 1/2         3.0
    (print-matrix (transpose mat3)) PRINTS
       1
       #c(5.0 2.0)
       1/2
       3.0
