    FUNCTION
    cos  -  get the cosine of a number or matrix

    Usage
    cos X

    DESCRIPTION
    This standard Common Lisp function has been modified to accept matrix as
    well  as  scalar  arguments.   When  the  argument  is  a scalar (i.e. a
    number), this function works just as when Allegro Matrix is not  loaded:
    returning  the cosine of the specified value in an appropriate numerical
    format.  When given a square matrix whose array element type is  one  of
    single-float,  double-float,  (complex  single-float),  (complex double-
    float), the matrix which is the cos of the matrix X  is  returned.   The
    cos  of  a matrix is defined below.  It is an error if X is not a number
    or a matrix.  If X is a matrix, it is an error if X is not square, if it
    has  an  array  element type other than the four listed above, or if its
    cos cannot be calculated for any reason (usually because the matrix can-
    not be inverted).

    The cos (or any such function applied to a matrix) is calculated as fol-
    lows.   A transformation matrix T and its inverse, T-inv, are calculated
    such that T-inv*x*T is diagonal (that is, the off diagonal elements  are
    zero). T is the matrix of eigen vectors where the vectors are the column
    of the matrix.  The function eigen-vectors returns a matrix  whose  rows
    are  the eigen vectors, so T is the result of (ntranspose (eigen-vectors
    x)).  The diagonal elements of T-inv*x*T are replaced with their cos and
    the modified diagonal matrix is retransformed by multiplying on the left
    by T and on the right by T-inv.  Note that NO checking is done to ensure
    that  the  diagonalized  matrix  is actually diagonal (that is, that the
    off-diagonal elements are zero to machine accuracy).  Only if the diago-
    nalization  process  actually  fails  will  any error be signaled.  Note
    further that there may be more than  one  possible  result  (because  of
    branch cuts, etc.), but only one result matrix, calculated as described,
    is returned.

    The returned matrix is of the same type as  the  argument  matrix.   The
    internal calculations are done as complex double-floats.  If X is a real
    matrix, it diagonalized counterpart is also real  (by  theory),  so  any
    imaginary  part  is  discarded.  (cos applied to a real returns a real.)
    Then the values are coerced to single or double, as appropriate.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We only show COS applied to matrices here:
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0) (-3.0 4.0))))
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      1.0  2.0
      -3.0 4.0
    ;;  COS will not work on a matrix whose element type is T:
    (cos mat) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Non-float matrix to function computed by diagonalization
    ;;  Now we set the element type of the matrix passed to COS:
    (print-matrix (cos (single-float-matrix mat))) PRINTS
      -1.261608  -2.0985003
      3.1477504  -4.4093585
