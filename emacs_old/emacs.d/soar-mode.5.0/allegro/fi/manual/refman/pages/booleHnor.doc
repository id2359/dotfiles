    CONSTANT
    boole-nor  -  specify bitwise logical `nor' operation

    DESCRIPTION
    Used as the first argument to boole to specify the bitwise boolean `nor'
    operation.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (Since bitwise logical operations interpret integers as
    ;;  half-infinite, the result is negative, which in two's-
    ;;  complement representation has an infinite string of 1's
    ;;  to the right, that is toward higher-order bits.  The
    ;;  number #b-1111 would be represented in two's-complement
    ;;  as ...111110001.)
    (boole boole-nor #b1100 #b1010) => #b-1111
    (ldb (byte 4 0) #b-1111) => #b1
    (logbitp 100 #b-1111) => t
