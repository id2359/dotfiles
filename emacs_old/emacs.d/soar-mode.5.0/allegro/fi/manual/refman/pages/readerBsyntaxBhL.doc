    READER SYNTAX
    #<  -  signals an error during read

    Usage
    #N<...>

    DESCRIPTION
    When the reader encounters the character ``#'', followed by an  optional
    unsigned decimal digit string, followed by ``<'', an error is signalled.

    When the printer prints an object that  cannot  later  be  read,  it  is
    printed  using  this  syntax.   The set of objects for which there is no
    printed representation is implementation-dependent.  However,  the  LISP
    objects  of  types  hash-table, readtable, package, stream, and function
    have no defined printed representation in COMMON  LISP.   These  objects
    may be printed using the ``#<'' syntax.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The printed representation is implementation-dependent.
    ;;  (An implementation may have a readable printed
    ;;  representation for hash-tables.)
    (copy-readtable) => #<readtable @ #x655aa1>
    #<readtable @ #x655aa1> => ERROR
