    NOTES
    about special forms  -  COMMON LISP special forms

    DESCRIPTION
    A special form is a construct that processes its subforms in an idiosyn-
    cratic  way.  For example, it may evaluate some subforms and not others,
    or it may not evaluate them left to right.  Special forms may also  per-
    form singular operations such as a nonlocal transfer of control.

    The set of special forms is fixed in COMMON LISP (there is  no  way  for
    users to define more):

    block                   if                      progv
    catch                   labels                  quote
    compiler-let            let                     return-from
    declare                 let*                    setq
    eval-when               macrolet                tagbody
    flet                    multiple-value-call     the
    function                multiple-value-prog1    throw
    go                      progn                   unwind-protect

    Any of the special forms above may be implemented as  macros.   Further,
    implementations  are free to implement any macro as a special form, pro-
    vided a macro definition is also available.  Therefore, it  is  possible
    that both macro-function and special-form-p will be true when applied to
    one of the special forms listed above and that both will  be  true  when
    applied  to  a  macro not in the list above. However, special-form-p can
    never return true when applied to a user-defined macro.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x 10)
    (set 'x 10)

    Both expressions above have the same effect at top  level,  setting  the
    global  value  of  symbol x to 10.  The setq special form does not, how-
    ever, evaluate its first argument, and it may  be  used  to  change  the
    value  associated  with  lexical  and dynamic variables, whereas set can
    only change the value of the current  dynamic  binding  (or  the  global
    value  if  there  is  no  binding)  of  a special variable.  The special
    functionality of setq motivates its status as a special form.
