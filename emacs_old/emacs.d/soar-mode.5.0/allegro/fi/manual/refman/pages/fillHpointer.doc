    FUNCTION
    fill-pointer  -  return the fill pointer of a vector

    USAGE
    fill-pointer vector

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the fill pointer of VECTOR.  It is a number between zero and the
    length of the vector, inclusive.  It is an error if the argument VECTOR,
    which must be a vector, does not have a fill pointer.  This function may
    be  used  in  conjunction  with  setf  to  change  the value of the fill
    pointer.

    A fill pointer specifies what portion of a vector is active. Most  func-
    tions  operating  on  vectors  operate only on the active portion of the
    vector, the active portion being the elements  whose  indices  are  from
    zero  to  one  less  than the value of the fill pointer.  (When the fill
    pointer is equal to the length of the vector, all of the elements of the
    vector  are  active.)  The  function  aref operates on the ENTIRE vector
    irrespective of its fill pointer.  For a vector to have a fill  pointer,
    it must have been created with one using the :fill-pointer keyword argu-
    ment to make-array.

    EXAMPLES
    (fill-pointer (make-array '(20) :fill-pointer 10)) => 10
