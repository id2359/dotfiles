    FUNCTION
    standard-char-p  -  test whether a character object is a standard char-
      acter

    USAGE
    standard-char-p char

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if CHAR is an object of type standard-char, and false  oth-
    erwise.  The argument CHAR must be an object of type character.

    The standard characters are those that must be supported in  any  imple-
    mentation  of  Common  Lisp, and are objects of type standard-char.  The
    standard characters are the 94 usual printing characters plus  #\Newline
    and  #\space.   Also, to be a standard character, a character's bits and
    font attributes must  be  zero.   (The  characters  are  listed  in  the
    standard-char entry which immediately precedes this entry.)

    EXAMPLES
    (standard-char-p #\a) => t
    (standard-char-p #\Newline) => t
    (standard-char-p #\Tab) => nil
    (standard-char-p #\Control-X) => nil
