    FUNCTION
    lcm  -  get the least common multiple of the arguments

    USAGE
    lcm {n}+

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the least common  multiple  of  the  arguments  (which  must  be
    integers).   By  definition,  the  least  common multiple of two nonzero
    integers is

    (lcm m n) = (/ (abs (* m n)) (gcd m n))

    In words, it is the smallest positive integer which the arguments divide
    evenly.  The result will be a non-negative integer.  Returns 0 if any of
    the arguments is zero.  Returns the absolute value of a single argument.

    EXAMPLES
    (lcm 12 16) => 48
    (lcm 1 2 3 4 0) => 0
    (lcm 1 2 3 -4) => 12
    (lcm -10 -20 -30) => 60
    (lcm -120 => 12
