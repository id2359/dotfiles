    Type SPECIFIER
    list  -  the data type comprising nil and cons

    Usage
    list

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies the data type list, which includes conses and the  empty  list
    () (or nil).

    The printed representation of a list is a  collection  of  LISP  objects
    surrounded  by parentheses.  How a list is printed depends on the values
    of the variables *print-length* and *print-level*.  Elements of the list
    left  out  because *print-level* is too small are replaced by suspension
    points (...).  Elements left out because *print-level* is too small  are
    replaced by sharp signs (#).  A printed representation containing either
    cannot be read.

    EXAMPLES
    (typep '(a b) 'list) => t
    (typep nil 'list) => t
    (typep '(a . b) 'list) => t
