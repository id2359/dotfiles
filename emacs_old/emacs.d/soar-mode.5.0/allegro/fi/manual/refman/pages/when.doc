    MACRO
    when  -  evaluate forms when a condition is true

    USAGE
    when test {form}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the values of the last FORM, if the form  TEST  evaluates  true,
    otherwise  returns  nil.   If  the TEST is true, the forms are evaluated
    sequentially as if in a progn.

    The following identities hold:

    (when test a b c) = (and test (progn a b c))
    (when test a b c) = (cond (test a b c))
    (when test a b c) = (if test (progn a b c) nil)
    (when test a b c) = (unless (not test) a b c)

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x 1.5) => 1.5
    (when (floatp x) (truncate x)) => 1 0.5s0
    (when (rationalp x) (setq x (numerator x)) (* x x)) => nil
    x => 1.5

    (setq x 5/3) => 5/3
    (when (floatp x) (truncate x)) => nil
    (when (ratiop x) (setq x (numerator x)) (* x x)) => 25
    x => 5
