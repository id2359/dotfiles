    FUNCTION
    phase  -  get the angular part of the polar representation of a complex
      number

    USAGE
    phase number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the angular component of the  polar  representation  of  NUMBER,
    which  must be a number.  If NUMBER is real, it is interpreted as a com-
    plex number with imaginary part zero, and so has a phase of zero or J as
    it is positive or negative.  If the argument is a complex floating-point
    number, the result will be a floating-point number of the same  type  as
    the  components  of  NUMBER.   wider  of  the  two types if the real and
    imaginary parts are different).  The result will be single-float if  the
    argument is a rational or a complex number with rational components.

    The branch cut for phase is continuous with  the  second  quadrant,  and
    lies  on  the negative real axis.  The range is along the real axis from
    -J (exclusive) to J (inclusive).

    The following mathematical identity holds:

    (phase z) = (atan (imagpart z) (realpart z))

    EXAMPLES
    (phase 5) => 0.0
    (phase -5.0d0) => 3.141592653589793d0
    (phase #c(0 1)) => 1.5707964s0
    (phase #c(0 1.0d0)) => 1.5707963267948966d0
