    FUNCTION
    make-concatenated-stream  -  make an input stream that reads successive
      streams

    USAGE
    make-concatenated-stream {stream}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns an input-only stream that  that  is  the  concatenation  of  the
    STREAMS.   The first stream is read until an end-of-file is reached, and
    then the second, and so on, for each of the streams.  Each  STREAM  must
    be  a  stream.   If  no STREAMS are specified, reading from the returned
    stream results in an immediate end-of-file.

    EXAMPLES
    (let* ((i1 (make-string-input-stream "beginning "))
           (i2 (make-string-input-stream "middle "))
           (i3 (make-string-input-stream "end"))
           (i4 (make-concatenated-stream i1 i2 i3)))
      (list (read i4) (read i4) (read i4)))
      => (beginning middle end)
