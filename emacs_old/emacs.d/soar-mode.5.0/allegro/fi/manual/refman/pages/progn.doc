    SPECIAL FORM
    progn  -  evaluate forms sequentially

    USAGE
    progn {form}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the values returned  by  the  last  FORM.   All  the  forms  are
    evaluated  sequentially.   The  values returned by forms before the last
    are discarded.  Thus, they are executed for  their  side  effects  only.
    progn with no forms returns nil.  progn (unlike prog1 and prog2) returns
    exactly what the last form returns, no values, one  value,  or  multiple
    values as appropriate.

    Many Common Lisp macros evaluate forms given as arguments in an  `impli-
    cit  progn'  (let and cond are examples).  This means that the forms are
    evaluated as if they were the arguments to progn.

    EXAMPLES
    (progn (setq x 4) (incf x)  (list 'result x)) => (result 5)
    (progn (truncate 1.5)) => 1 0.5
    ;;  PROGN returns no values when the last form returns no values.
    (multiple-value-list (progn (values))) => nil
