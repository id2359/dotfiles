    FUNCTION
    fround  -  round and convert to floating-point number

    USAGE
    fround number [divisor]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns two values, Q and R.  Q is the result of rounding  the  quotient
    of  NUMBER  and  DIVISOR,  coerced  to  be a float.  R is the difference
    between NUMBER and Q times DIVISOR.  That is

    r = NUMBER - q*DIVISOR

    The result of rounding a number is the integer closest in value  to  the
    number.   If  a number is equidistant between two integers (that is, has
    fractional part 0.5 exactly), the result is the even integer (coerced to
    a float).

    If DIVISOR is not specified, it defaults to 1, so the  first  result  is
    NUMBER rounded.

    The rounded value is floated before it is returned.  Its format  is  the
    format  of  NUMBER, single-float in the case where NUMBER is a rational.
    The format of the second returned value follows the rules  of  floating-
    point  contagion (applied before Q is converted to a float).  Therefore,
    the second value may  be  an  integer  if  both  of  the  arguments  are
    integers.

    Both arguments must  be  real  numbers,  either  integer,  rational,  or
    floating-point.

    EXAMPLES
    (fround 5.3) => 5.0 0.3
    (fround 5 2) => 2.0 1
    (fround -5 2) => -2.0 -1
    (fround -5.2 2) => -3.0 0.8
    (fround 3.5) => 4.0 -0.5
    (fround 4.5) => 4.0 0.5
