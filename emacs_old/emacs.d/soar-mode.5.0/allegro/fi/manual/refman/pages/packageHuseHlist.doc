    FUNCTION
    package-use-list  -  find all packages used by a package

    USAGE
    package-use-list package

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a list of all the other packages used by PACKAGE.  PACKAGE  must
    be  a  package.  When one package uses another, all the exported symbols
    of the used package become accessible by inheritance in the using  pack-
    age.   When  the  using  package is current, the external symbols of the
    used package are accessible without a package qualifier.  (Note that  an
    exported  symbol  in a used package with the same print name as a symbol
    on the shadowing-symbols list of the using package can only be  accessed
    with a package-qualifying prefix.)

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The user package uses the lisp package.
    (if (member (find-package :lisp)
                (package-use-list (find-package :user)))
        'yes 'no) => yes

    ;;  But the lisp package does not use the user package.
    (if (member (find-package :user)
                (package-use-list (find-package :lisp)))
        'yes 'no) => no
