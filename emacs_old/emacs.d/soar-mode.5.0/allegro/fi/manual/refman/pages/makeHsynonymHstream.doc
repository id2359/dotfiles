    FUNCTION
    make-synonym-stream  -  make a stream that always operates on a stream
      bound to a given symbol

    USAGE
    make-synonym-stream symbol

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a synonym stream. Operations on the returned stream will  always
    be  carried  out  on the stream that is bound (at the time of the opera-
    tion) to the symbol SYMBOL.  (The binding used is the dynamic binding in
    the context of the operation.)

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The printed representation of streams is
    ;;  implementation-dependent.
    (setq stan (make-synonym-stream '*terminal-io*))
      => #<synonym stream for *terminal-io* @ #x4ce699>
    ;;  Writing to STAN prints to the terminal.
    (format stan "hello") => nil
      PRINTS Hello
