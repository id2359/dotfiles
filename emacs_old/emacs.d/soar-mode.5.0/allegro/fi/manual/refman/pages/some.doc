    FUNCTION
    some  -  test whether at least one element of a sequence satisfies a
      predicate

    Usage
    some PRED {SEQUENCE}+

    DESCRIPTION
    This function applies the predicate PRED  to  successive  elements  from
    each  sequence.   PRED must take as many arguments as there are argument
    sequences.  The first application of PRED is to all the  first  elements
    of SEQUENCES.  The second is to all the second elements, and so on.  The
    first time PRED returns true (a non-nil value), some returns that  value
    without  further  computation.   If  the end of any argument sequence is
    reached without PRED having returned true, some returns nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (some #'eq '(1 2 3) '(4 5 3)) => t
    (some #'oddp '(2 4 5)) => t
    (some #'atom '((a) (b) (1 2 3))) => nil
