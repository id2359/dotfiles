    FUNCTION
    bit-orc1  -  perform a bitwise logical `or' of the complement of a bit
      array and another bit array

    USAGE
    bit-orc1 bit-array1 bit-array2 [result-array]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    If RESULT-ARRAY is provided as  an  argument,  then  it  will  hold  the
    results  of  the  logical  operation and thus be modified.  RESULT-ARRAY
    must be a bit array of the same rank and dimensions  as  the  other  two
    arguments.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise  logical `or' of the complement of  BIT-ARRAY2,  and
    the  complement of BIT-ARRAY1.  Both must be bit arrays of the same rank
    and dimensions.  The result is produced by performing the  operation  on
    corresponding  elements  of  the  two  arrays.  If the optional argument
    RESULT-ARRAY is not provided, a new bit array is created  and  returned.
    The logical `or' of a bit I complemented and a bit J is 0 if and only if
    I is 1 and J is 0.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  #* is the reader macro for bit vectors.
    (setq bit-arr (make-array 4 :element-type 'bit))
    (bit-orc1 #*1100 #*1010 bit-arr) => #*1011
    bit-arr => #*1011
