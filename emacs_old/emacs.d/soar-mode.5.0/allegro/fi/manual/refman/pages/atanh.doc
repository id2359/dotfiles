    FUNCTION
    atanh  -  get the hyperbolic arc tangent of a number

    USAGE
    atanh number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the hyperbolic arc tangent of NUMBER.  (That is, the value whose
    hyperbolic  tangent  is NUMBER).  The value returned is complex when the
    absolute value of NUMBER is greater than 1.

    There are two portions to the branch cut for atanh.  One lies along  the
    negative  real axis from -1 (inclusive) to negative infinity, continuous
    with the third quadrant, and the other lies along the positive real axis
    from  1  (inclusive)  to  positive  infinity,  continuous with the first
    quadrant.  The domain does not include the points -1 and 1.   The  range
    consists  of points in the complex plane whose real part is between -J/2
    (including the end point if the real part is strictly negative), and J/2
    (including the end point if the real part is strictly positive).

    EXAMPLES
    (atanh 0) => 0.0
    (atanh 2) => #c(0.54930615 1.5707964)
