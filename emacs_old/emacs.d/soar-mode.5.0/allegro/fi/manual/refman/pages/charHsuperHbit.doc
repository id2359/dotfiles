    CONSTANT
    char-super-bit  -  weight of the super bit of characters

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to the integer weight assigned to the super bit  of  the  bits
    attribute  of character objects.  An implementation need not support the
    super bit.  If it does, the value of this constant is  4.   If  it  does
    not, the value is 0.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following result is implementation-dependent:
    char-super-bit => 4
