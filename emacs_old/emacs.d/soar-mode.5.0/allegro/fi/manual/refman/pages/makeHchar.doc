    FUNCTION
    make-char  -  create a character with specified bits and font

    USAGE
    make-char char [bits [font]]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a character object with the same code attribute as CHAR, a  bits
    attribute of BITS, and a font attribute of FONT, provided such a charac-
    ter is possible, and returns nil otherwise.  The argument CHAR must be a
    character  object.   The  optional  arguments BITS and FONT must be non-
    negative integers.  Both default to 0.   If  BITS  and  FONT  are  zero,
    make-char will always successfully return a character with the same code
    as CHAR.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  These examples assume the implementation supports
    ;;  the control bit attribute:
    (make-char #\Control-\A) => #\A
    (make-char #\Control-\a) => #\a
