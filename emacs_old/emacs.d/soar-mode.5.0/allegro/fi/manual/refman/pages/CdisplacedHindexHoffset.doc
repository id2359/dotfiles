    KEYWORD ARGUMENT
    :displaced-index-offset  -  specify offset in a displaced-to array

    USAGE
    :displaced-index-offset index

    SIDE EFFECTS
    When an array W is created or adjusted with array V as the value of  the
    :DISPLACED-TO  keyword  argument,  W is said to be displaced to array V.
    Viewing both arrays as one dimensional (following the convention that an
    array  is  stored so that the last dimension varies fastest, that is, in
    row-major oreder), the first element of W is the element of V  specified
    by one plus the value of the :displaced-index-offset.

    DESCRIPTION
    This  keyword  argument  may  be  used   with   either   make-array   or
    adjust-array,  but  only  when  the :displaced-to keyword option is also
    used. Its value must be a fixnum.

    When used with make-array, the size of the newly created array plus this
    value can be no larger than the size of the array being displaced to.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq A (make-array 10
                        :adjustable t
                        :initial-contents '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)))
      => #(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
    (setq B (make-array 5 :displaced-to A
                        :displaced-index-offset 3)))
      => #(4 5 6 7 8)
