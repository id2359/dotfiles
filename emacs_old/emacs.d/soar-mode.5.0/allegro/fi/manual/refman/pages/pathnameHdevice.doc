    FUNCTION
    pathname-device  -  get the device component of a pathname

    USAGE
    pathname-device path

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the device component of PATH.  The device is one of the six com-
    ponents  of  a pathname (the other five are directory, host, name, type,
    and version).  PATH must be a pathname, string, symbol, or stream.   (If
    PATH is a stream, it must be, or have been, open to a file.)

    The device component of a pathname is implementation-dependent, but  may
    be nil or :wild.  nil indicates that the device is unspecified; :wild is
    a device component that  `matches'  any  device  when  the  pathname  it
    appears  in  is  used  in a directory-search operation such as that per-
    formed by directory.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following example refers to a file on a VMS file system.
    (pathname-device "pleiades::sys$sysdisk:[sys0.sysexe]lisp.exe;0")
      => "SYS$SYSDISK"
