    FUNCTION
    tailp  -  test whether one list is a sublist of another list

    USAGE
    tailp sublist list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if SUBLIST is a  sublist  of  LIST,  and  false  otherwise.
    Equivalently,  SUBLIST  must be eq to one of the conses at the top level
    of LIST.  If SUBLIST is a tail of LIST, then SUBLIST can be accessed  by
    some number of successive applications of cdr to LIST.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq a '(m n o p q r)) => (m n o p q r)
    (setq b (cddr a)) => (o p q r)
    (tailp b a) => t
    (tailp '(o p q r) a) => nil
