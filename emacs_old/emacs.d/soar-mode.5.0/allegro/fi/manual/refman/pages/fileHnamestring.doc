    FUNCTION
    file-namestring  -  return the name, type, and version components of a
      pathname as a string

    USAGE
    file-namestring pathname

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a string representing the name, type, and version components  of
    PATHNAME,  which  must  be  a  pathname,  string, symbol, or stream.  If
    PATHNAME is a stream, it must be or have been open to a file.

    Not all the pathname components listed above may be present in any given
    implementation.  It may not necessarily be possible to construct a valid
    namestring by concatenating  the  values  returned  by  host-namestring,
    directory-namestring, and file-namestring on a given pathname.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The result is implementation-dependent:
    (file-namestring (make-pathname :host "franz"
                                    :directory "/etc"
                                    :name "foo" :type "l"))
      => "foo.l"
