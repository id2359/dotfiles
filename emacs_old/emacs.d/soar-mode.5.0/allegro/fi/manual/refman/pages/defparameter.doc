    MACRO
    defparameter  -  declare a special program parameter (destructive)

    USAGE
    defparameter name initform [doc-string]

    DESCRIPTION
    Proclaims the variable NAME to be special, assigns the value of INITFORM
    to it, and returns NAME.  This macro is usually used to declare and ini-
    tialize globally-defined variables at the top level,  where  changes  to
    such  variables  are considered to be changes to the program.  Otherwise
    it is like a defvar with a required INITFORM that  is  always  evaluated
    and  stored  in  the  variable.   If  specified,  a documentation string
    DOC-STRING of type variable is associated with NAME.

    Global variables modified by a program  can  be  defined  using  defvar.
    Parameters  used  by a program that can be changed by the user to affect
    the operation of the program should be defined using defparameter.

    EXAMPLES
    (defparameter *max-files* 32) => *max-files*
    (defparameter *float-test-fuzz* .000001
      "Single precision floating point variation")
      => *float-test-fuzz*
