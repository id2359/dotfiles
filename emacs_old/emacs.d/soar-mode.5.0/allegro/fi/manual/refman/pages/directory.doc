    FUNCTION
    directory  -  get a list of pathnames matching a given pathname

    USAGE
    directory pathname

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a list of pathnames matching PATHNAME, which may be a  pathname,
    string,  or stream associated with a file.  The value nil is returned if
    no files match PATHNAME.  It may be especially useful if  keywords  such
    as  :wild  and :newest appear in PATHNAME (in which case the list of the
    pathnames identical in all other respects is returned).   Each  pathname
    in the returned list is the truename of a file.

    EXAMPLES
    Suppose you had four files with the same name  component  but  different
    types on a hypothetical system.  You might observe behavior like this:

    (mapcar #'file-namestring
      (directory (make-pathname :name "prog" :type :wild)))
      => ("prog.listing" "prog.out" "prog.fasl" "prog.cl")
