    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~R  -  print integer in specified radix

    USAGE
    ~radix,mincol,padchar,commachar[:][@]R

    DESCRIPTION
    Prints the next format argument in the radix RADIX if the argument is an
    integer,  and  in  ``~A'' format with radix RADIX (if applicable) other-
    wise.  If no prefix parameters are given, a special radix interpretation
    is applied according to the following modifier combinations.

    ~R   Prints as a cardinal English number, such as four.

    ~:R  Prints as an ordinal English number, such as fourth.

    ~@R  Prints as a Roman numeral, such as IV.

    ~:@R Prints as an old Roman numeral, such as IIII.

    When at least one prefix parameter is given, the ``~R'' format directive
    is  similar  to  the ``~D'' directive.  In particular, it never prints a
    decimal point after the number, and the sign is not printed  unless  the
    number is negative or the ``@'' modifier is given.

    The prefix parameter MINCOL (default 0) specifies that enough copies  of
    the  padding  character,  PADCHAR (default the space character `` '') be
    added to the beginning of the output string to make it consume at  least
    MINCOL  columns.   If  the  ``:''  modifier  is  given,  the  character,
    COMMACHAR (default ``,'') appears between every three digits.

    EXAMPLES
    (format nil "~R ~2R ~8R ~10R ~16R ~32R" 31 31 31 31 31 31)
      => "thirty-one 11111 37 31 1f v"
    (format nil "|~:@R ~14,10,,'x:@R|" 25 25)
      => "|XXV        +1b|"
