    Type SPECIFIER
    random-state  -  the data type comprising states of the random-number
      generator

    USAGE
    random-state

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies the data type consisting of data structures used to  hold  the
    state  of  a  pseudorandom  number generator. The type of the underlying
    data structures is implementation-dependent.

    The printed representation of a random-state object  is  implementation-
    dependent  but must be able to be read back (at least by the same imple-
    mentation).

    EXAMPLES
    (typep *random-state* 'random-state) => t
    ;;  In this implementation, a random-state is
    ;;  implemented as a structure:
    *random-state* => #s(random-state :seed 7791641717136025225)
