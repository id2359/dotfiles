    VARIABLE
    *query-io*  -  interactive input/output stream

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to a stream to which user questions are sent  and  from  which
    responses  are  read.  This is the preferred stream for user interaction
    (as opposed to *standard-input* and *standard-output*), and is  used  by
    functions such as yes-or-no-p.

    EXAMPLES
    Evaluating
    (print (cons 'a (read *query-io*)) *query-io*)
    with user input (b c d) causes (a b c d) to be written to the *query-io*
    stream (usually the user's terminal) as a side effect.
