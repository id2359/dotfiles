    SPECIAL FORM
    the  -  declare the type of the value of a form

    USAGE
    the type form

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The values returned by FORM may be checked to make sure they are of  the
    types indicated.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns whatever FORM returns.  The purpose of this special form  is  to
    provide a way to declare the types of the results of evaluating isolated
    forms.  To use the with a form that returns more than one value,  use  a
    values type specifier. A values type specifier is an ordered list of the
    symbol values and as many type specifications as there are values to  be
    returned. It is an error if FORM does not return an object of type TYPE.
    Like other type declarations, those specified in a the form are advisory
    to  the  system, and an erroneous return type may not result in an error
    being signalled.  However, many implementations check  for  this  error,
    particularly in interpreted code.

    EXAMPLES
    (defun integer-half (num)
      (the integer (/ num 2)))
    (integer-half 4) => 2
    (integer-half 3) => ERROR
    ;;  3/2 is not an integer.
    (the (values integer rational) (round 5/6 3/4)) => 1  1/12
