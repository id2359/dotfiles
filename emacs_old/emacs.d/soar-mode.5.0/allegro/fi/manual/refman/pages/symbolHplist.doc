    FUNCTION
    symbol-plist  -  get the list that holds the property pairs of a symbol

    USAGE
    symbol-plist symbol

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a list that holds  the  property  (indicator,  value)  pairs  of
    SYMBOL.   Note  that you cannot use get on the list returned from a call
    to symbol-plist.  You must either use getf or pass the symbol itself  to
    get.  You may  use setf with symbol-plist to replace the entire property
    list, although this is generally the wrong thing to do.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf (get 'bills 'water) 20) => 20
    (setf (get 'bills 'rent) 300) => 300
    (symbol-plist 'bills) => (water 20 rent 300)
