    SPECIAL FORM
    multiple-value-call  -  collect all values returned by a sequence of
      forms and apply a function

    USAGE
    multiple-value-call fun {form}*

    DESCRIPTION
    This special form evaluates FUN and then  evaluates  each  FORM  sequen-
    tially,  storing  all  returned values.  FUN must evaluate to a function
    (specifically, an object suitable as the  first  argument  to  apply  or
    funcall).   All  the stored values are then passed as distinct arguments
    to the function.  multiple-value-call returns exactly what the  function
    returns.

    EXAMPLES
    (multiple-value-call #'list
      (floor 4.5) (floor 5.5)) => (4 0.5 5 0.5)
    (multiple-value-call #'list
      (floor 4.5) 'foo)  => (4 0.5 foo)
