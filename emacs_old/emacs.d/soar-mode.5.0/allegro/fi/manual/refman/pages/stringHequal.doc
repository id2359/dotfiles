    FUNCTION
    string-equal  -  test whether two strings are the same, ignoring case

    USAGE
    string-equal string1 string2 [:start1 s1] [:end1 e1] [:start2 s2]
      [:end2 e2]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if corresponding characters of  the  strings  specified  by
    STRING1  and  STRING2 differ only in case, and false otherwise.  STRING1
    and STRING2 must be strings or symbols.  The print names of symbols  are
    used as the strings.

    This function is similar to string=, except  string-equal  ignores  case
    and string= observes case distinctions.  string-equal uses char-equal to
    compare characters.

    To operate on a substring of STRING1, use the :start1 and :end1  keyword
    arguments.   The  :start1  keyword  argument  specifies the index of the
    first character of the substring  of  STRING1  to  examine.   Its  value
    defaults  to  zero  (indicating the first character).  The :end1 keyword
    argument specifies an index one greater than the index of the last char-
    acter of STRING1 to examine. A value of nil is equivalent to the default
    value, the length of the string.  Note that if STRING1 is a string  with
    a  fill  pointer,  only  the active elements of STRING1 can be compared.
    These remarks also apply to the :start2  and  :end2  keyword  arguments,
    which  specify  the  starting  and  ending  indices  of the substring of
    STRING2.

    If the substrings or strings being compared are  not  of  equal  length,
    string-equal will return nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (string-equal "Hello" "hello") => t
    (string= "Hello" "hello") => nil
