    VARIABLE
    *all-window-streams*  -  list of all window-streams known to this Lisp
      session

    DESCRIPTION
    Bound to a list of all the window-streams which are currently  allocated
    in this LISP environment.  Both :active and :inactive window-streams are
    included in this this, but window-streams that  have  been  flushed  are
    not.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  In this example, when we initialize Common Windows, the only
    ;;  window-stream is the prompt window:
    (initialize-common-windows)
    *all-window-streams* => (#<window-stream @ #xbd9469>)
    ;;  The address will differ each run, of course, but we
    ;;  know that is the prompt window because the same object
    ;;  is the value of *PROMPT-WINDOW*:
    *prompt-window* => #<window-stream @ #xbd9469>
    ;;  When create another window-stream, it gets added to the
    ;;  list.  Note that it is not active, so that is not a factor:
    (setf *my-win* (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
                                       :height 100 :width 100))
      => #<window-stream @ #xbdd7e1>
    *all-window-streams*
      => (#<window-stream @ #xbd9469> #<window-stream @ #xbdd7e1>)
    ;;  Now when we flush *MY-WIN*, it is taken off the list:
    (flush *my-win*)
    *all-window-streams* => (#<window-stream @ #xbd9469>)
