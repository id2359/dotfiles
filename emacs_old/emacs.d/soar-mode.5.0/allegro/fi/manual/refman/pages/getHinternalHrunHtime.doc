    FUNCTION
    get-internal-run-time  -  get the current run time in Internal Time for-
      mat

    Usage
    get-internal-run-time

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns an integer that is the amount of  time  spent  actually  working
    since   LISP   was  started.   The  meaning  of  `actually  working'  is
    implementation-dependent.  Possible interpretations include  CPU  cycles
    (normalized,  as  necessary,  by  the clock rate), running time, or even
    real time.  In any case, the value is supposed to represent time working
    (rather than time elapsed, which is measured by get-internal-real-time).
    Dividing     the     value     returned     by     the     value      of
    internal-time-units-per-second  gives  the time in seconds.  The differ-
    ence between the values returned by two calls to  this  function  should
    reflect the amount of useful computational time expended between the two
    calls.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  This value is implementation- and situation-dependent.
    (get-internal-run-time) => 3583
