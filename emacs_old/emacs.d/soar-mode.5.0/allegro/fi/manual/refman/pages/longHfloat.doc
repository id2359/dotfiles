    Type SPECIFIER
    long-float  -  the data type long-float

    USAGE
    {long-float | (&Elong-float [{low | (low)} [{high | (high)}]])}

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a data type consisting of long-format  floating-point  numbers
    between  LOW  and  HIGH.   Either  limit  is  considered exclusive if it
    appears in a list by itself, otherwise it is considered inclusive.   The
    limits  should be specified as long-format floating-point numbers or may
    be explicitly unspecified using *.  Frequently, implementations are less
    restrictive in the numeric format of the limits.

    The long-float type is the subtype of  float  with  greatest  precision.
    The  COMMON LISP standard allows considerable COMMON LISP freedom in the
    implementation of floats.   It  is  possible  that  long-float  will  be
    equivalent to double-float for example.  You may discover the details of
    the implementation you are using with  functions  like  float-precision,
    which  returns  the  number  of  digits  in the internal representation.
    Floating-point numbers of this type may be expressed using the  exponent
    marker  L  or  l  (lowercase  L).   If the value of *read-default-float-
    format* is long-float, the exponent markers e and E  also  signify  long
    floats.

    EXAMPLES
    (typep 0.4l1 '(long-float 0.0 1.0)) => t
    (subtypep 'long-float 'float) => t t
    ;;  This last result is implementation-dependent.
    (float-precision 2.0L0) => 53
