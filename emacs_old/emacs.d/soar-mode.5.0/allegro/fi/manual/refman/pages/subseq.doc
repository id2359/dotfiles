    FUNCTION
    subseq  -  get a subsequence of a sequence

    Usage
    subseq SEQUENCE START [END]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns copy of the subsequence of SEQUENCE bounded by  START  and  END.
    SEQUENCE must be a sequence.

    Indexing is zero-origin, with START a non-negative  integer  designating
    the  first  element  of  the  subsequence  and  END (if supplied) a non-
    negative integer designating the first element  after  the  subsequence.
    END  defaults to the length of SEQUENCE, which value is also used if END
    is nil.

    subseq may be used with setf to destructively modify the contents  of  a
    subsequence of SEQUENCE.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq seq1 '(1 2 3 4))
    (subseq seq1 1 3) => (1 2)
    (subseq seq1 0 4) => (1 2 3 4)
    (setf (subseq seq1 1 3) '(a b)) => (0 a b 3)
