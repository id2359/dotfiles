    FUNCTION
    atan  -  get the arc tangent of a number or of a quotient

    USAGE
    atan number [denom]

    DESCRIPTION
    When one argument is given, returns the  arc  (or  inverse)  tangent  of
    NUMBER,  that  is  an  angle whose tangent is NUMBER.  NUMBER may be any
    number, real or complex, in the one argument case.  With two  arguments,
    returns  the  arc  tangent  of  the  quotient of NUMBER and DENOM.  Both
    NUMBER and DENOM must be real in the two argument case.   The  signs  of
    NUMBER  and DENOM are used to determine the quadrant of the result.  The
    result will be an angle which in standard position (with  one  side  the
    x-axis) has one side in the same quadrant as the point ( DENOM, NUMBER).
    The range is from -J (exclusive) to J (inclusive) in  the  two  argument
    case.   An  error is signaled if both NUM and DENOM are zero in the two-
    argument case.  (If only DENOM is zero, the result is J/2 or -J/2 as NUM
    is  positive  or negative.) An error is also signaled if any argument is
    not a number.

    There are two portions to the branch cut for atan.  One lies  along  the
    positive  imaginary  axis  from i (exclusive) to positive infinity, con-
    tinuous with the second quadrant, and the other lies along the  negative
    imaginary axis from -i (exclusive) to negative infinity, continuous with
    the fourth quadrant.  The range consists of points in the complex  plane
    whose  real  part  is  between  -J/2   (including  the  end point if the
    imaginary part is strictly positive), and J/2 (including the  end  point
    if the imaginary part is strictly negative).

    EXAMPLES
    (atan 1) => 0.7853982
    (atan #c(1.0 2.3)) => #c(1.3900658 0.37153915)
    (atan 0) => 0.0
    (atan 3 4) => 0.6435011
    (atan -3 4) => -0.6435011
    (atan 3 -4) => 2.4980915
    (atan -3 -4) => -2.4980915
