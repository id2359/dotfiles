    FUNCTION
    lognand  -  bitwise logical `nand'

    USAGE
    lognand n1 n2

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `nand' of N1 and N2, both of which  must  be
    integers.   Arguments  and  results are interpreted as if represented in
    two's-complement notation.  The following identity holds:

    (lognand x y) = (lognot (logand x y))

    EXAMPLES
    (lognand -1 -5) => 4

    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (Since bitwise logical operations interpret integers as
    ;;  half-infinite, the result is negative, which in two's-
    ;;  complement representation has an infinite string of 1's
    ;;  to the right, that is toward higher-order bits.  The
    ;;  number #b-1001 would be represented in two's-complement
    ;;  as ...111110111.)
    (lognand #b1100 #b1010) => #b-1001
    (ldb (byte 4 0) #b-1001) => #b111
    (logbitp 100 #b-1001) => t
