    FUNCTION
    terpri  -  output a newline to a stream

    Usage
    terpri [STREAM]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A newline is appended to the end of the output stream.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil, but this function is used for its side effects.

    The argument STREAM defaults to the value of *standard-output*, which is
    also the value used if STREAM is nil.  Otherwise, the argument must be a
    stream, or t, in which case it takes on the value of *terminal-io*.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Note in the following script that FRESH-LINE only outputs
    ;;  a newline if it has to, while TERPRI always does.
    <cl> (progn (format t  "fred") (terpri)
           (fresh-line t) (format t  "fred"))

    fred
    fred
    nil
