    VARIABLE
    *print-pretty*  -  variable that controls the appearance of printed ob-
      jects

    DESCRIPTION
    When this variable is true, the printer will  print  expressions  in  an
    aesthetically   pleasing   manner,   typically  making  liberal  use  of
    whitespace and newlines to indent expressions in order to reflect  their
    semantics  or structure.  The exact definition of `pretty' and the stan-
    dards of indentation are implementation-dependent.

    When this variable is false, printing will use  the  minimum  amount  of
    whitespace.   The  initial  value  of  the  variable  is implementation-
    dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following value and the appearance of prettified
    ;;  output is implementation-dependent.
    *print-pretty* => nil

    (defun test () '(this is the test))
    (let ((*print-pretty* nil))
      (print (function test)))
      PRINTS (lambda nil (block test '(this is the test)))

    (let ((*print-pretty* t))
      (print (function test)))
      PRINTS (lambda ()
               (block test
                 '(this is the test)))
