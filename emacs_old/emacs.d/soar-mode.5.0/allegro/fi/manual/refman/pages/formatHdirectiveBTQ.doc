    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~?   -  process argument as recursively called control string

    USAGE
    ~[@]?

    DESCRIPTION
    Processes the next format argument,  which  must  be  a  string,  as  an
    indirect format control string and then resumes normal processing of the
    current control string.  The argument which is the indirect string  nor-
    mally must be followed by another argument (a list) which supplies argu-
    ments to it, but if the ``@'' modifier is  given,  the  indirect  string
    consumes  arguments  from  the same list that the current control string
    uses.

    This directive must nest properly with respect to other  format  control
    structure  directives.   The  ``~^''  directive may be used to terminate
    processing of the indirect string and  resume  processing  the  original
    string after the ``~?'' directive.

    EXAMPLES
    (format nil "~? ~A" "~D ~D" '(3 4) 'foo)
      => "3 4 foo"
    (format nil "~@? ~A" "~D ~D" 3 4 'foo)
      => "3 4 foo"
