    MACRO
    prog2  -  evaluate forms sequentially, returning exactly one value from
      the second form

    USAGE
    prog2 first-form second-form {form}*

    DESCRIPTION
    The first two  (required)  argument  forms  are  evaluated.   The  first
    returned value from the SECOND-FORM is saved and the remaining forms are
    evaluated sequentially.  When all have been evaluated, the single  saved
    value  from  the SECOND-FORM is returned.  prog2 is useful when you wish
    to evaluate a number of forms for their side effects and need some value
    after one side effect form has executed.

    prog2 returns only one value.   If  the  second  form  returns  multiple
    values,  all but the first are discarded.  If the second form returns no
    values, prog2 returns nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (prog2 (setq lis '(3 4 2 3 4 2 1))
       (setq lis (sort lis #'<))
       (setq lis (remove-duplicates lis)))
       => (1 2 2 3 3 4 4)
    lis => (1 2 3 4)
    (prog2 (setq forget 10) (values)) => nil
    (prog2 (setq x 1.5) (truncate x)) => 1
    ;;  Contrast the last example with progn:
    (progn (setq x 1.5) (truncate x)) => 1 0.5
