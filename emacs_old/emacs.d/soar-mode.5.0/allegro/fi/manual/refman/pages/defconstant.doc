    MACRO
    defconstant  -  declare a symbol to hold a constant value

    USAGE
    defconstant name initform [doc-string]

    DESCRIPTION
    Proclaims the variable NAME to be special, assigns the value of INITFORM
    to  it,  makes it henceforth read-only, and returns NAME.  It is usually
    used to declare and initialize globally-defined  constants  at  the  top
    level.   Otherwise  it  is  like a defparameter with a guarantee, to the
    compiler, for example, that the value  of  NAME  will  not  change.   If
    specified,  a  documentation string DOC-STRING of type variable is asso-
    ciated with NAME.  It is an error for NAME to  have  a  special  binding
    when  defconstant is evaluated.  Either assignment or dynamic binding of
    NAME becomes an error.  (Lexical bindings are not possible since NAME is
    declared special.)

    EXAMPLES
    (defconstant pi-over-2 (/ pi 2.0)) => pi-over-2
    (defconstant soupcon (* 3 smidgens)
      "Fuzzy precision cooking measure equivalence") => soupcon
