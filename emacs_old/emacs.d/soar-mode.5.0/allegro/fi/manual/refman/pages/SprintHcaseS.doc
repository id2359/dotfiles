    VARIABLE
    *print-case*  -  variable that determines the case in which symbol names
      are printed

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to a keyword indicating how symbol names  should  be  printed.
    The  three choices are :upcase, :downcase, and :capitalize.  Print names
    of symbols are normally converted to uppercase when they are first read.
    This  variable  controls how uppercase characters in print names will be
    printed.  In :upcase mode, uppercase characters are  printed  in  upper-
    case.  In :downcase mode, uppercase characters are printed in lowercase.
    In :capitalize mode, uppercase characters are printed in uppercase  when
    they  occur  at  the  beginning of words and in lowercase elsewhere.  In
    this context, a `word' is defined to  be  a  substring  of  alphanumeric
    characters delimited at either end by a nonalphanumeric or by the begin-
    ning or the end of the string that is the print name of the symbol.

    Note that lowercase characters in the internal print name  of  a  symbol
    are always printed in lowercase and are preceeded by an escape character
    if the value of *print-escape* is true.

    The initial value of the variable is :upcase.

    EXAMPLES
    *print-case* => :upper
    (let ((*print-case* :upcase))
      (write-to-string 'FOO)) => "FOO"
    (let ((*print-case* :downcase))
      (write-to-string 'FOO)) => "foo"
    (let ((*print-case* :capitalize))
      (write-to-string 'FOO.BAR)) => "Foo.Bar"
