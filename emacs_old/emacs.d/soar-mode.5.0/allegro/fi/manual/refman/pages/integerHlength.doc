    FUNCTION
    integer-length  -  get number of bits required to store the absolute
      magnitude of a given integer

    Usage
    integer-length N

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a non-negative integer giving the minimum number of bits  needed
    to  represent  the the absolute magnitude of N (excluding the sign bit).
    The value is calculated as follows.

    (integer-length n) = (if (< n 0)
                             (ceiling (log (- n) 2))
                             (ceiling (log (+ n 1) 2)))

    Thus N, which must be an integer, can  thus  be  represented  in  signed
    two's-complement  notation in the returned number of bits plus one, and,
    if positive, in the returned number of bits as an unsigned byte.

    EXAMPLES
    (integer-length 0) => 0
    (integer-length 1) => 1
    (integer-length 7) => 3
    (integer-length 8) => 4
    (integer-length -7) => 3
    (integer-length -8) => 3
    (integer-length -9) => 4
    (integer-length #b010011) => 5
