    VARIABLE
    *print-escape*  -  controls whether printed objects can generally be
      read back in

    DESCRIPTION
    When this variable is true, the printer attempts to print expressions in
    such  a  way  that  the reader will read back equal expressions.  Escape
    characters may be output as part of this process.  If this  variable  is
    false,  then  escape characters are not output. The function princ never
    prints escape characters and so effectively binds *print-escape* to nil,
    while  prin1 always prints escape characters and so effectively binds it
    to t.

    The initial value of *print-escape* is t.

    EXAMPLES
    *print-escape* => t
    (let ((*print-escape* t)) (write #\newline)) => #\newline
      PRINTS #\newline
    (let ((*print-escape* nil)) (write #\newline)) => #\newline
      PRINTS

    ;;  A new line is printed.
