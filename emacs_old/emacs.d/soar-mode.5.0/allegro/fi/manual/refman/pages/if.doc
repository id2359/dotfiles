    SPECIAL FORM
    if  -  simple two-branch conditional

    USAGE
    if test-part then-part [else-part]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the result of THEN-PART if TEST-PART is true, otherwise  returns
    the  result of ELSE-PART, if it is specified, or nil.  This special form
    first evaluates the TEST-PART.  If this evaluates to  a  non-nil  (true)
    value,  the  THEN-PART  is evaluated and returned as the value of the if
    form.  If TEST-PART evaluates to nil, the  ELSE-PART  is  evaluated  and
    returned.   Only  the  selected  expression is evaluated.  Note that all
    three arguments must be single forms.

    EXAMPLES
    (if (= 2 2)
        (format nil "truth")
        (format nil "falsehood")) => "truth"
    (if (= 2 3)
        (format nil "truth")
        (format nil "falsehood")) => "falsehood"
