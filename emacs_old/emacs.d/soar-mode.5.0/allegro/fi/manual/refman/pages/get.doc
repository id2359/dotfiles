    FUNCTION
    get  -  retrieve a property value from the property list

    USAGE
    get symbol indicator [default]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the value which is paired with INDICATOR on the property list of
    SYMBOL, and returns DEFAULT if no such pair is found.  The property list
    is searched for a pair whose key is eq to INDICATOR.  If  no  such  pair
    exists,  DEFAULT  is  returned.   If  DEFAULT  is  not specified, nil is
    returned.

    There is no way to distinguish  between  a  property  found  with  value
    DEFAULT and DEFAULT being returned because no property was found.  (But,
    as the last example shows, if DEFAULT is an object which CANNOT  be  the
    value  of  a property, then DEFAULT being returned means the property is
    not present on the list.  In the example, DEFAULT is a  symbol  returned
    by gensym created when get is called.)

    setf may be used with get to change the value of a property on the  pro-
    perty  list  or  to  add  a new property.  setf does not use the DEFAULT
    value although it is not an error to specify  it.   Other  macros  asso-
    ciated  with setf, such as incf and push, may use the default value when
    used in conjunction with get in the following  way.   When  the  default
    value  is  provided and the property indicator is not found, the default
    value is used as if were the value associated with  the  indicator,  the
    value  is  modified,  then  it  is stored on the property list under the
    given indicator.

    The following identity holds:

    (get s p) = (getf (symbol-plist s) p)

    EXAMPLES
    (setf (symbol-plist 'customers)
      '(:smith (bonus1 basic) :jones (bonus2 basic)))
      => (:smith (bonus1 basic) :jones (bonus2 basic))
    (get 'customers :smith) => (bonus1 basic)
    (get 'customers :jones) => (bonus2 basic)
    (get 'customers :green) => nil
    (setf (get 'customers :green) '(basic)) => (basic)
    (get 'customers :green) => (basic)
    (push  'bonus3 (get 'customers :green 'foo)) => (bonus3 basic)
    (get 'customers :white 'not-a-customer) => not-a-customer
    (push 'bonus1 (get 'customers :white '(basic))) => (bonus1 basic)

    (defun prop? (symbol indicator &aux (none (gensym)))
      "Always returns NIL if there is no property with
      the given INDICATOR on SYMBOL"
      (not (eq (get symbol indicator none) none)))
