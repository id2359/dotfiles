    FUNCTION
    rplaca  -  replace the car of a list (destructive)

    USAGE
    rplaca x y

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The argument X is changed.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the argument X, which must be a cons, after first replacing  its
    car  with  the arbitrary object Y.  Use this function with caution since
    when it is applied to lists which share storage with other lists,  unex-
    pected results may occur.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq c '(w x y z)) => (w x y z)
    (rplaca (cddr c) '(u v)) => ((u v) z)
    c => (w x (u v) z)
