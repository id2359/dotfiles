    FUNCTION
    get-internal-real-time  -  get the current time in Internal Time format

    Usage
    get-internal-real-time

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the value of the current time as an  integer  in  Internal  Time
    format.  Internal Time format is an implementation-dependent representa-
    tion of time, with the units and time zero depending  (usually)  on  the
    supplied  hardware.   This  function  is usually used to measure elapsed
    time.  Dividing the difference of the returned values from two calls  to
    get-internal-real-time  by  the  value of internal-time-units-per-second
    gives the time elapsed between the two calls in seconds.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  This value is implementation- and time-dependent.
    (get-internal-real-time) => 3287320490
