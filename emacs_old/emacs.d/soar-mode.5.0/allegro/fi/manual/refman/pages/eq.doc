    FUNCTION
    eq  -  test whether arguments denote the same object

    USAGE
    eq x y

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if arguments  X  and  Y  are  implementationally  identical
    objects.   (Being  eq  means that the arguments refer to the same memory
    address.) Note that eq is a stringent  test:  objects  having  the  same
    printed representation are not necessarily eq.  Moreover, constants that
    are eq in compiled code may not be eq in interpreted code.

    Numbers and characters cannot be reliably or portably be  compared  with
    eq.   They  should  instead  be  compared with eql, or = for numbers and
    char= for characters.

    EXAMPLES
    (eq 'a 'a) => t
    (eq (cons 'a nil) (cons 'a nil)) => nil
