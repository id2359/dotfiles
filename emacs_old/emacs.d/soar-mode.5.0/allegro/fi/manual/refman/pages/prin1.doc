    FUNCTION
    prin1  -  print an object

    Usage
    prin1 OBJECT [STREAM]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The printed representation of OBJECT is written to STREAM.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns OBJECT, but this function is used for its  side  effects.   This
    function  outputs  to  STREAM characters that represent OBJECT.  This is
    usually done in such a way that the object may be read back  with  read.
    It  effectively binds *print-escape* to true while printing OBJECT.  The
    following code equivalence holds.

    (prin1 object stream) = (write object :stream stream :escape t)

    The argument STREAM may be a stream that accepts output, or  STREAM  may
    be  t or nil.  If STREAM is nil, output goes to *standard-output*, which
    is also the default value if STREAM is not specified.  If STREAM  is  t,
    output goes to *terminal-io*.  The difference between prin1 and print is
    that print outputs a newline before and a space after printing OBJECT.

    EXAMPLES
    (prin1 "this is a test") => "this is a test"
      PRINTS "this is a test"
    (prin1 #\newline) => #\newline
      PRINTS #\newline
    (princ "this is a test") => "this is a test"
      PRINTS this is a test
    (princ #\newline) => #\newline

    ;;  A new line is printed by the last form.
