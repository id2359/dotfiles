    FUNCTION
    listen  -  check whether any characters are available for input

    Usage
    listen [STREAM]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if there is a character immediately available from  STREAM,
    otherwise  returns  false.   This  function  is particularly useful with
    interactive streams, such as one connected to  a  keyboard.   When  used
    with  noninteractive  streams,  listen returns true unless the next read
    operation would be at the end-of-file.

    The argument STREAM may be a stream,  t,  or  nil.   If  it  is  nil  or
    unspecified,  *standard-input*  is  used.   If it is t, *terminal-io* is
    used.

    EXAMPLES
    (with-open-file (io "junk" :direction :io
                        :if-exists :append
                        :if-does-not-exist :create)
      (values (listen io)
              (progn (write t :stream io)
                     (file-position io :start)
                     (listen io)))) => nil t
