    FUNCTION
    make-package  -  create a new package

    USAGE
    make-package package-name [:nicknames names] [:use packages]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a newly-created package named PACKAGE-NAME, which must either be
    a  string or a symbol.  You may specify nicknames for the new package by
    using the :nicknames keyword argument.  The argument  NAMES  must  be  a
    list  of  strings  or  symbols. When a symbol is specified for a name or
    nickname, the print name is used as the string.  When a string  is  sup-
    plied, it must be in the desired case.  (Note that for standard symbols,
    their print names are in upper case.) Neither the name nor the nicknames
    can  denote  other  existing packages.  A continuable error will be sig-
    nalled if there is such a conflict.

    PACKAGES, the value of the :use keyword argument, should be  a  list  of
    packages  or  strings or symbols denoting packages.  These packages will
    be used (in the sense of use-package: their  exported  symbols  will  be
    inherited)  by  the  new  package.   All  the  packages in the list must
    already exist.  PACKAGES defaults to the list containing only  the  lisp
    package.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following form will create the FOO package if it does
    ;;  not already exist.  The printed representation of a package object is
    ;;  implementation-dependent.
    (unless (find-package :foo)
        (make-package :foo)) ; create the foo package
