    Type SPECIFIER
    standard-char  -  the data type comprising the standard COMMON LISP
      character set

    USAGE
    standard-char

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies the data type consisting of those characters which  must  must
    be supported in any implementation of COMMON LISP.  Any COMMON LISP pro-
    gram written in characters of this type is guaranteed to be readable  by
    any other COMMON LISP implementation.

    The standard characters consist of the following 94  printed  characters
    and the characters #\Newline and #\Space.

    a           b           c           d           e           f
    g           h           i           j           k           l
    m           n           o           p           q           r
    s           t           u           v           w           x
    y           z
    A           B           C           D           E           F
    G           H           I           J           K           L
    M           N           O           P           Q           R
    S           T           U           V           W           X
    Y           Z
    1           2           3           4           5           6
    7           8           9           0
    "           !           #           $           %           &
    <           =           >           ?           @           [
    ]           ^                      {           |           }
    ~           /           \           (           )           *
    +           -

    These 94 printing characters correspond to the 94 ASCII printing charac-
    ters, although, of course, an implementation's character set need not be
    base on ASCII coding.

    EXAMPLES
    (typep #\x 'standard-char) => t
    (typep #\Tab 'standard-char) => nil
