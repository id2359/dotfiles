    VARIABLE
    *print-base*  -  variable that determines radix in which rationals are
      printed

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to the radix in which rationals will be printed.  *print-base*
    must  be an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to
    36.  For radices larger than ten, digits beyond  9  are  indicated  with
    letters  of  the  alphabet.   In base 15, for example, a or A represents
    ten, b or B eleven, c or C  twelve  and  so  on.   (Thus,  in  base  36,
    thirty-five is represented by z or Z.)

    The initial value of this variable  is  ten.   (We  give  the  value  in
    English  since whatever the value of this variable, its value is printed
    as `10.')

    Floating-point numbers are always printed in base ten regardless of  the
    value of this variable.

    EXAMPLES
    (let ((*print-base* 2)) (write-to-string 2)) => "10"
    (let ((*print-base* 2)) (write-to-string 1/2)) => "1/10"
    (let ((*print-base* 10)) (write-to-string 2)) => "2"
    (let ((*print-base* 10)) (write-to-string 1/2)) => "1/2"
