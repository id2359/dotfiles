    FUNCTION
    rationalize  -  convert a noncomplex number to a rational number

    USAGE
    rationalize number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a rational number equal to NUMBER, making  the  assumption  that
    NUMBER  is  only  as precise as its floating-point representation.  This
    function tries to keep both numerator and denominator small, unlike  the
    function rational, which assumes that NUMBER is accurate.

    EXAMPLES
    (rationalize 4) => 4
    (rationalize 1/2) => 1/2
    (rationalize 0.125000000001) => 1/8
