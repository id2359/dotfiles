    CONSTANT
    most-negative-long-float  -  the long-float closest to negative infinity

    DESCRIPTION
    This constant evaluates to the value of the long-float number nearest to
    (but  still  different  from)  negative  infinity.   The  value  of this
    constant is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  This value is implementation-dependent.
    most-negative-long-float => -4.4942328371557866d+307
