    MACRO
    define-modify-macro  -  define a new generalized-variable manipulating
      macro

    USAGE
    define-modify-macro name lambda-list function [doc-string]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    Defines a read-modify-write macro called NAME.  The purpose of the macro
    NAME  is to provide a particular way of manipulating a generalized vari-
    able, so as to change its contents.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns NAME, after defining it as a new macro that operates on general-
    ized  variables.  When this macro is called, the first subform will be a
    generalized-variable reference.  The remaining subforms in the call  are
    described  by  LAMBDA-LIST.   The  argument  FUNCTION is the name of the
    function that will be  applied  to  the  contents  of  the  generalized-
    variable  reference, followed by the arguments described by LAMBDA-LIST.
    The function should return the new value of  the  generalized  variable.
    The  lambda  list  may only contain &optional and &rest lambda-list key-
    words.  The optional  documentation  argument,  DOC-STRING,  attaches  a
    documentation string of type function to the macro NAME.

    define-modify-macro ensures that a macro is created  that  observes  the
    semantic  rules  for  macros  that manipulate generalized variables (see
    setf).

    EXAMPLES
    (define-modify-macro modf
        (divisor)
      mod "Modify first argument to be result of mod")

    (setf x 10)
    (modf x 2) => 0
    x => 0
