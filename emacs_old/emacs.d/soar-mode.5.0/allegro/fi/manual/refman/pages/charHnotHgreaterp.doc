    FUNCTION
    char-not-greaterp  -  test whether given characters are monotonically
      nondecreasing, ignoring case and bits

    USAGE
    char-not-greaterp {char}+

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if each CHAR is less than or equal  to  the  next  argument
    CHAR  specified  and  returns  nil otherwise.  char-not-greaterp ignores
    case and any bits attributes and takes font attributes into  account  in
    an  implementation-dependent way.  Each CHAR must be a character object.
    The ordering on characters obeys alphabetic ordering within letters, and
    numeric  ordering  within the digits 0 through 9.  Digits are not inter-
    leaved with letters, but whether a digit is less than or greater than  a
    letter  depends  on  the  implementation.   The  function char<= is like
    char-not-greaterp except that it also checks case,  and  bits  and  font
    attributes.

    EXAMPLES
    (char-not-greaterp #\b #\b) => t
    (char-not-greaterp #\b #\c) => t
    (char-not-greaterp #\c #\b) => nil
    (char-not-greaterp #\b #\B) => t
    (char-not-greaterp #\B #\b) => t
    (char<= #\b #\B) => nil
    (char-not-greaterp #\b) => t

    ;;  The following result is implementation-dependent:
    (char-not-greaterp #\a #\1) => nil
