    FUNCTION
    room  -  print information about internal storage

    Usage
    room [VERBOSE]

    DESCRIPTION
    The returned value is unspecified, but this function  is  used  for  its
    side effects.  When called, room prints to *standard-output* information
    about the state of the internal storage and how  it  is  being  managed.
    VERBOSE  may be nil, t, or unspecified.  (An implementation may take any
    non-NIL value to be equivalent to t or  it  may  do  different  specific
    things  for  different  non-nil  values.)  In any case, a value of t for
    VERBOSE causes the most information to be printed, nil the least, and no
    value  specified  an  intermediate amount.  The information provided and
    its format are implementation dependent.  Its purpose is to provide data
    that may be helpful in tuning a program (or tuning implementation param-
    eters when presented with a program) for optimal performance and  memory
    usage.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  In the implementation used for the examples in
    ;;  this book, ROOM prints as follows.  The information may
    ;;  be very different in other implementations, since memory
    ;;  management schemes differ considerably.  In this example,
    ;;  memory is divided into new and tenured spaces, holding
    ;;  newly created and long-lived objects, respectively.
