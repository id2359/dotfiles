    FUNCTION
    first  -  get the first element of a list

    USAGE
    first list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the first element of LIST, where the car of LIST  is  considered
    to be the first element.  LIST must be a list.

    Unlike the nth function, which uses zero-origin indexing, this  function
    uses  one-origin indexing.  If LIST is empty, nil is returned.  setf may
    be used with third to replace the first element of a list.

    EXAMPLES
    (first '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => a
    (first '()) => nil
    (setq lis '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => (a b c d e f g h i j)
    (setf (first lis) 1) => 1
    lis => (1 b c d e f g h i j)
