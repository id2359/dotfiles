    Lambda-List KEYWORD
    &whole  -  bind entire macro-call form

    USAGE
    &whole macro-call-var

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies that during macro expansion, MACRO-CALL-VAR be  bound  to  the
    entire  macro-call form.  The &whole lambda-list keyword can only appear
    in a defmacro, macrolet, or define-setf-method  form  and  must  be  the
    first  element  in the lambda-list form.  After MACRO-CALL-VAR is bound,
    the argument list is inherited intact by later parts of the lambda-list.

    EXAMPLES
    (defmacro m (&whole all a b)
      `(list ',all ,b ,a)) => m
    (m 2 3) => ((m 2 3) 3 2)
