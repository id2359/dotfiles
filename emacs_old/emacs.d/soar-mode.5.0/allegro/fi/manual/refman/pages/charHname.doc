    FUNCTION
    char-name  -  get the name of a character

    USAGE
    char-name char

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the name of CHAR as a string if it has one, and  nil  otherwise.
    The  argument  CHAR,  which must be a character object, has a name if it
    has zero bits and font attributes and does  not  satisfy  the  predicate
    graphic-char-p.  A graphic character may or may not have a name.

    The names of the standard and semistandard  non-graphic  characters  are
    "Space",  "Newline",  "Tab", "Page", "Rubout", "Linefeed", "Return", and
    "Backspace".  (An implementation may not support  all  these  characters
    and  may  support  others  not  listed.)  Character  names are not case-
    sensitive.  char-name does not use bits or font attributes in construct-
    ing character names even if they are present in CHAR.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The returned values are implementation-dependent:
    (char-name #\a) => nil
    (char-name #\space) => "Space"
    (char-name #\newline) => "Newline"
