    FUNCTION
    pathname-type  -  get the type component of a pathname

    USAGE
    pathname-type path

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the type component of PATH.  The type is one  of  the  six  com-
    ponents of a pathname (the other five are device, directory, host, name,
    and version).  PATH must be a pathname, string, symbol, or stream.   (If
    PATH  is  a  stream, it must be, or have been, open to a file.) The type
    component of a pathname is implementation-dependent, but  it  may  be  a
    string,  nil,  or  :wild.   nil  indicates that the type is unspecified;
    :wild is a type that `matches' any type when the pathname it appears  in
    is  used  in  a  directory-search  operation  such  as that performed by
    directory.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following example refers to a file on a VMS file system.
    (pathname-type "pleiades::sys$sysdisk:[sys0.sysexe]lisp.exe;0")
      => "EXE"
