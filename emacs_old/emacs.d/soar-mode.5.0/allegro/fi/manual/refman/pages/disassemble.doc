    FUNCTION
    disassemble  -  `unassemble' compiled code and print it out

    Usage
    disassemble NAME-OR-FUNCTION

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The  functional  object  denoted  by  NAME-OR-FUNCTION  is  compiled  if
    necessary.

    DESCRIPTION
    Displays assembly-language instructions for a compiled function  object,
    thus    providing   information   about   how   compiled   code   works.
    NAME-OR-FUNCTION should either be a function object,  a  lambda  expres-
    sion,  or  a  symbol with a function definition.  If the function is not
    compiled, disassemble will first compile it and then disassemble it.

    Exactly what is printed, how it is printed, and what,  if  anything,  is
    returned by this function is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following is part of what is printed when
    ;;  a function is disassembled on a Motorola 68000
    ;;  68000 machine in one implementation (note that the
    ;;  function is compiled during the disassembly):
    (defun foo ()
      (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0))
               nil)) => nil
    (compiled-function-p #'foo) => nil
    (disassemble 'foo) PRINTS
    ;; disassembling #<Function foo @ #x3bc909>
    ;; formals:

    ;; code vector @ #x574b4c
    0:      link    a6,#0
    4:      move.l  a2,-(a7)
    6:      move.l  a5,-(a7)
    8:      move.l  7(a2),a5
    12:     move.l  d3,d4           ; nil
    14:     move.l  #1,d1
    16:     move.l  -8(a6),a5
    20:     unlk    a6
    22:     rtd     #0

    (compiled-function-p #'foo) => t
