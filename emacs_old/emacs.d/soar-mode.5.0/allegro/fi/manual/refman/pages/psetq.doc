    MACRO
    psetq  -  parallel variable assignment (destructive)

    USAGE
    psetq {var form}*

    SIDE EFFECTS
    For each VAR the result of evaluating the corresponding FORM  is  stored
    in VAR.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil, but this macro is used for its side effects.  psetq differs
    from  setq  only in assigning values in parallel.  If a FORM refers to a
    variable VAR that is also being assigned by the psetq  form,  the  value
    seen  is the value BEFORE VAR is bound by the psetq form.  setq, in con-
    trast, assigns values sequentially.  Like setq, psetq may  be  used  for
    assignment  of  both dynamic and lexical variables.  The values modified
    are those associated with the variables named by the symbols VAR in  the
    context within which the psetq form appears or is evaluated.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x 4) => 4
    (psetq x 5 y x) => nil
    x => 5
    y => 4
