    FUNCTION
    pathname-name  -  get the name component of a pathname

    USAGE
    pathname-name path

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the name component of PATH.  The name is one  of  the  six  com-
    ponents of a pathname (the other five are device, directory, host, type,
    and version).  PATH must be a pathname, string, symbol, or stream.   (If
    PATH is a stream, it must be, or have been, open to a file.)

    The name component of a pathname is implementation-dependent, but may be
    nil  or  :wild.   nil indicates that the name is unspecified; :wild is a
    name which `matches' any name when the pathname it appears in is used in
    a directory-search operation such as that performed by directory.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following example refers to a file on a VMS file system.
    (pathname-name "pleiades::sys$sysdisk:[sys0.sysexe]lisp.exe;0")
      => "LISP"
