    FUNCTION
    gethash  -  get the value associated with a key in a hash table

    USAGE
    gethash key hash-table [default]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns two values:  the value in HASH-TABLE associated with KEY, and  a
    boolean  value  that  is true if and only if there is a value associated
    with KEY in HASH-TABLE.  If KEY is not found, the first  value  returned
    is DEFAULT, or nil if DEFAULT is not specified.  The HASH-TABLE argument
    must be of type hash-table.  KEY may be any LISP object.

    Entries are usually added to a hash-table using setf with gethash.  When
    used  with  setf,  the DEFAULT argument is ignored, and the new value is
    associated with KEY, replacing the existing value if there is one.  When
    used  with  other macros related to setf, such as incf, which modify the
    value stored in the generalized variable specified  by  their  argument,
    the  DEFAULT value is taken to be the value that will be modified if the
    given KEY is not found.  The modified default value is then stored  into
    the given HASH-TABLE under the given KEY.

    EXAMPLES
    (progn (setq ht (make-hash-table))
      (gethash 'quick ht 'not-home)) => not-home nil
    (progn
      (setf (gethash 'quick ht) 'brown)
      (setf (gethash 'fox ht) 'jumped)
      (setf (gethash 'over ht) 'fence)
      (list
        (gethash 'quick ht) (gethash 'fox ht)
        (remhash 'fox ht) (gethash 'fox ht)))
      => (brown jumped t nil)
    (hash-table-count ht) => 2
    (gethash 'number ht) => nil nil
    (incf (gethash 'number ht 20)) => 21
    (gethash 'number ht) => 21 t
