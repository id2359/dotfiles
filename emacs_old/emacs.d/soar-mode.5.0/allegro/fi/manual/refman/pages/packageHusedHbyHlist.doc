    FUNCTION
    package-used-by-list  -  get names of all other packages that use a
      specified package

    USAGE
    package-used-by-list package

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a list of all other packages that use PACKAGE.  PACKAGE must  be
    a  package.   When one package uses another, all the exported symbols of
    the used package become accessible by inheritance in the using  package.
    When  the  using  package  is  current, the external symbols of the used
    package are accessible without a package qualifier.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The lisp package is used by the user package.
    (if (member (find-package :user)
                (package-used-by-list
                 (find-package :lisp)))
        'yes 'no) => yes

    ;;  But the user package is not used by the lisp package.
    (if (member (find-package :lisp)
                (package-used-by-list
                 (find-package :user)))
        'yes 'no) => no
