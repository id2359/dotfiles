    FUNCTION
    software-type  -  get the name of any relevant supporting software

    Usage
    software-type

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the string  identifying  the  generic  name  of  the  supporting
    software relevant to the Common Lisp you are running.  If no appropriate
    value can be found, it will return nil.  The precise value  returned  is
    implementation-dependent.   Typically, the string returned will identify
    the `operating system' on top of which the LISP implementation  is  run-
    ning.

    EXAMPLES
    (software-type) => "VAX/VMS"
