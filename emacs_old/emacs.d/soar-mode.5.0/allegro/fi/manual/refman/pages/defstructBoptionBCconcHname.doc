    DEFSTRUCT OPTION
    :conc-name  -  customize the prefix name for defstruct accessor func-
      tions

    Usage
    :conc-name NAME

    DESCRIPTION
    This is a defstruct option that specifies  the  prefix  used  for  slot-
    accessor  functions associated with a structure.  The argument NAME must
    be a symbol.  It is not evaluated.  The default accessor function prefix
    is  the structure name followed by a hyphen.  When you specify an expli-
    cit name, however, the system does not automatically  supply  a  hyphen.
    If  the  argument NAME is nil, then no prefix is used and the slot names
    themselves are used as the names of the accessor functions.

    Note that when you use a constructor function to create an instance of a
    structure, you should specify the slot with just the name of the slot as
    a keyword and without a prefix.  You DO use the prefix, however when you
    use  setf to set the values for individual slots in the structure, since
    setf methods are defined for the slot-accessor functions.

    EXAMPLES
    (defstruct (book (:conc-name tome-)) title length) => book
    (setq my-book (make-book :title "Life With Charlie" :length 400))
      => #s(book :title "Life With Charlie" :length 400)
    (tome-title my-book) => "Life With Charlie"
    (setf (tome-length my-book) 100) => 100

    (defstruct (magazine (:conc-name nil)) title) => magazine
    (setq my-mag (make-magazine :title 'Life))
      => #s(magazine :title Life)
    (title my-mag) => Life
