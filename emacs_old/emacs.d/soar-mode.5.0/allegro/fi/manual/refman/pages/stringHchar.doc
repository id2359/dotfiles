    Type SPECIFIER
    string-char  -  the data type comprising characters that may be elements
      of a string

    USAGE
    string-char

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies the data type string-char, which consists  of  all  characters
    whose bits and font attributes are zero.  These characters may appear in
    strings.

    A character object may be an element of a string if and only if it is of
    type   string-char.    All   standard   characters   (objects   of  type
    standard-char) satisfy  string-char-p.   Other  implementation-dependent
    characters may also satisfy string-char-p.

    EXAMPLES
    (typep #\x 'string-char) => t
    (typep #\Meta-x 'string-char) => nil
