    Type SPECIFIER
    pathname  -  the data type comprising pathnames

    Usage
    pathname

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies the data  type  consisting  of  objects  that  represent  file
    specifications in a portable way.

    The printed representation of a pathname is implementation-dependent but
    must be able to be read back (at least by the same implementation).

    EXAMPLES
    (typep (pathname "foo") 'pathname) => t
    ;;  The following printed representation is
    ;;  implementation-dependent, but can be read
    ;;  back in this implementation:
    (pathname "foo") => #p"foo"
