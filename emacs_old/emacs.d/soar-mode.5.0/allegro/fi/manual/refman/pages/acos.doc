    FUNCTION
    acos  -  get the arc cosine of a number

    USAGE
    acos number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the arc (or inverse) cosine of NUMBER,  that  is,  a  number  in
    radians whose cosine is NUMBER.  The argument may be of any number type,
    including complex.  A non-numeric argument signals an error.  The result
    may be complex, as in cases when the absolute value of NUMBER is greater
    than 1.

    There are two portions to the branch cut for acos.  One lies  along  the
    negative  real axis from -1 (inclusive) to negative infinity, continuous
    with the second quadrant, and the other lies  along  the  positive  real
    axis from 1 (inclusive) to positive infinity, continuous with the fourth
    quadrant.  The range consists of points in the complex plane whose  real
    part  is  between  0  (including  the end point if the imaginary part is
    non-negative), and J (including the end point if the imaginary  part  is
    non-positive).

    EXAMPLES
    (acos 1/2) => 1.0471976
    (acos 0) => 1.5707964
    (acos 3) => #c(0.0 1.7627472)
    (acos .8) => 0.6435011
