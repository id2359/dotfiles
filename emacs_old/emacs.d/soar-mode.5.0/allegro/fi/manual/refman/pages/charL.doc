    FUNCTION
    char<  -  test whether given characters are monotonically increasing

    USAGE
    char< {char}+

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if each argument CHAR is less than the next  argument  CHAR
    specified,  and  false otherwise.  Each CHAR must be a character object.
    The ordering on characters obeys alphabetic  ordering  within  uppercase
    and  lowercase letters, and numeric ordering within the digits 0 through
    9.  Digits are not interleaved with letters nor  are  uppercase  letters
    interleaved  with  lowercase,  but  whether uppercase is greater or less
    than lowercase and whether digits  are  greater  or  less  than  letters
    depends  on the implementation.  The ordering by char< of two characters
    that differ only in their code attributes is consistent  with  numerical
    ordering  by  <  on  their code attributes (returned by char-code).  The
    ordering of characters by char< for characters that differ  in  bits  or
    font  attributes  is  implementation-dependent.  Such an ordering is not
    necessarily identical to the ordering of values returned by char-int  of
    the characters.

    EXAMPLES
    (char< #\b #\b) => nil
    (char< #\b #\c) => t
    (char< #\b) => t
    (char< #\a #\b #\c) => t
    (char< #\a #\a #\b) => nil

    ;;  The following results are implementation-dependent:
    (char< #\a #\A) => nil
    (char< #\2 #\a) => t
