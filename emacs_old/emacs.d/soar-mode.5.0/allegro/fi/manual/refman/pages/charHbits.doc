    FUNCTION
    char-bits  -  get the bits attribute of a character object

    USAGE
    char-bits char

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bits attribute of CHAR, which must be  a  character  object.
    The  value returned is a non-negative integer that is strictly less than
    char-bits-limit.  This integer is the sum of the weights of the  charac-
    ter   bits   in   CHAR.    The   set  of  bits  that  are  supported  is
    implementation-dependent, however if the control bit  is  supported,  it
    has  weight  1,  meta  has  weight  2, super has weight 4, and hyper has
    weight 8.

    EXAMPLES
    (char-bits #\A) => 0

    ;;  The returned value is implementation-dependent:
    (char-bits #\Control-A) => 1
