    FUNCTION
    compile-file  -  compile a file containing COMMON LISP source code

    Usage
    compile-file INPUT-FILE [:output-file OUTPUT-FILE]

    DESCRIPTION
    This function returns nil.  The argument INPUT-FILE must specify a  file
    containing  COMMON  LISP  source  forms.  It may be a pathname, a string
    (namestring), a symbol (the print-name is used as the file  namestring),
    or  a  stream  (the  file associated with the stream is used).  The file
    specified is compiled, producing another file  containing  object  code.
    The INPUT-FILE specification is merged with *default-pathname-defaults*.
    The  default  conventions  for  the  output  file   specifications   are
    implementation-dependent.   The name of the output file may be specified
    explicitly by the OUTPUT-FILE keyword  argument,  which  is  subject  to
    implementation-dependent   merging   with   appropriate  defaults.   The
    object-code file that is produced may be  loaded  into  COMMON  LISP  by
    using the load function.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Compile the file "foo.lsp".
    (compile-file "foo.lsp")

    ;;  Compile the file "bar.lsp",
    ;;  specifying the name of the output file.
    (compile-file "bar.lsp" :output-file "bar.fasl")
