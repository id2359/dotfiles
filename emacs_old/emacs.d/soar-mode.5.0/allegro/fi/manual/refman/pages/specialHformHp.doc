    FUNCTION
    special-form-p  -  test whether a symbol is the global name for a spe-
      cial form

    USAGE
    special-form-p symbol

    DESCRIPTION

    Returns a non-nil value if SYMBOL names a special form, and  nil  other-
    wise.   A non-nil value may be an implementation-dependent function that
    may be used to evaluate the special form.  The standard COMMON LISP spe-
    cial forms are

    block                   if                      progv
    catch                   labels                  quote
    compiler-let            let                     return-from
    declare                 let*                    setq
    eval-when               macrolet                tagbody
    flet                    multiple-value-call     the
    function                multiple-value-prog1    throw
    go                      progn                   unwind-protect

    An implementation may choose to implement any macro as  a  special  form
    for  speed.  Thus special-form-p may be true of symbols other than those
    just enumerated.  Further,  in  these  cases  macro-function  will  also
    return  a  non-nil  value since a macro definition must be available for
    implementation-dependent special forms.  Conversely, the  standard  spe-
    cial  forms may be implemented as macros, in which case again both func-
    tions will return non-nil values.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Many implementations return some non-NIL value other than T.
    (special-form-p 'car) => nil
    (special-form-p 'setq) => t
    ;;  The remaining results are implementation-dependent.
    (macro-function 'setq) => nil
    (special-form-p 'do) => t
