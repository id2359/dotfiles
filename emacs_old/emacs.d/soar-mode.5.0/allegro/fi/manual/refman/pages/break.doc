    FUNCTION
    break  -  Print a break message and go into the debugger

    USAGE
    break [format-string {arg}*]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A break message is printed and COMMON LISP goes into the debugger.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil, but this function is used for its side effects.  It is used
    to insert break points into a program, not to signal errors.  A break is
    continuable.  The FORMAT-STRING and ARG arguments are passed  to  format
    to display a message to *error-output*.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The details of the following script are
    ;;  implementation-dependent.
    <cl> (FLET ((TEST (NUM)
                  (WHEN (EVENP NUM)
                    (BREAK "~D IS THE SUPPLIED NUMBER." NUM))))
           (TEST 4))
    Break: 4 is the supplied number.
    Restart actions (select using :continue):
     0: return from break.
    [1c] <cl> :CONTINUE
    nil
    <cl>
