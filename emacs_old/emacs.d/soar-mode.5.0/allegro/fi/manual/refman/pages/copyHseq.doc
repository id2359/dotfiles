    FUNCTION
    copy-seq  -  copy a sequence

    Usage
    copy-seq SEQUENCE

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a copy of SEQUENCE.  The returned  sequence  is  equalp  to  the
    SEQUENCE, but not eq to it.  Calling this function is equivalent to cal-
    ling subseq with large enough boundaries to copy the entire sequence.

    EXAMPLES
    (copy-seq '(a b c d)) => (a b c d)
    (setq a (make-sequence 'string 5 :initial-element #\c)) => "ccccc"
    (setq b (copy-seq a)) => "ccccc"
    (eq a b) => nil
    (equalp a b) => t
