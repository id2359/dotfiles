    FUNCTION
    ninth  -  get the ninth element of a list

    USAGE
    ninth list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the ninth element of LIST, where the car of LIST  is  considered
    to be the first element.  LIST must be a list.

    Unlike the nth function, which uses  zero-origin  indexing,  ninth  uses
    one-origin  indexing.   If the list has fewer than nine elements, nil is
    returned.  setf may be used with ninth to replace the ninth element of a
    list.

    EXAMPLES
    (ninth '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => i
    (ninth '(a)) => nil
    (setq lis '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => (a b c d e f g h i j)
    (setf (ninth lis) 9) => 9
    lis => (a b c d e f g h 9 j)
