    FUNCTION
    write-to-string  -  write the printed representation of an object to a
      string

    Usage
    write-to-string OBJECT [:escape ESCAPE] [:radix RADIX] [:base BASE]
      [:circle CIRCLE] [:pretty PRETTY] [:level LEVEL] [:length LENGTH]
      [:case CASE] [:gensym GENSYM] [:array ARRAY]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the string of characters that would  be  output  for  OBJECT  by
    write.   Each  of the keyword arguments corresponds to one of the global
    variables that controls stream output and defaults to the current  value
    of  that  global  variable.   For  example, the keyword argument :escape
    corresponds to the global variable *print-escape*.

    EXAMPLES
    (write-to-string '(this is a test list))
      => "(this is a test list)"
    (write-to-string "string" :escape nil) => "string"
    (write-to-string 5 :radix t :base 2) => "#b101"
    (write-to-string 10 :radix t :base 10) => "10."

    (setq old '(a b c))
    (setf (cddr old) old)  ; tail points to head
    (write-to-string  old :circle t) => "#1=(a b . #1#)"

    (write-to-string #'(lambda() '(test function)) :pretty t)
      => "(lambda () '(test function))"
    (setq nester
      (write-to-string
       '(alpha (a1 (a11 (a111 a112) a12) a2) beta)
       :level 1)) => "(alpha # beta)"
    (setq lengthy
      (write-to-string
       '(alpha (a1 (a11 (a111 a112) a12) a2) beta)
       :length 1) => "(alpha ...)"
    (write-to-string 'foo :case :upcase) => "FOO"
    (write-to-string (gensym) :gensym nil) => "g4"
    (write-to-string (gensym) :gensym t) => "#:g5"
    (write-to-string (make-array '(2 3)
                                 :initial-contents
                                 '((a b c)(d e f)))
                     :array t) => "#2a((a b c) (d e f))"
    (write-to-string (make-array '(2 3)
                                 :initial-contents
                                 '((a b c)(d e f)))
                     :array nil) => "#<Array, rank 2 @ #x31e819>"
