    MACRO
    time  -  get information about the time it takes to run a function

    Usage
    time FORM

    SIDE EFFECTS
    Timing information is written to the *trace-output* stream.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the result of evaluating FORM.  Also writes  timing  information
    to  the stream that is the value of *trace-output*.  The exact nature of
    the information is implementation-dependent but should include data such
    as  machine  run  time,  real  time,  and storage management statistics.
    Accuracy of time is constrained by the granularity of any clock which it
    utilizes.  Consequently time output may not be meaningful for forms that
    run too short a  time  (for  example,  less  than  one  second  on  some
    machines).

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The output from TIME looks like this in one implementation:

    (defun doit (n) (time (dotimes (i n) (cons nil nil)))) => doit
    (compile 'doit) => doit
    (doit 100000) => nil
      PRINTS  ; to *TRACE-OUTPUT*
    cpu time (non-gc) 834 msec user, 16 msec system
    cpu time (gc)     216 msec user, 0 msec system
    cpu time (total)  1050 msec user, 16 msec system
    real time  1120 msec
