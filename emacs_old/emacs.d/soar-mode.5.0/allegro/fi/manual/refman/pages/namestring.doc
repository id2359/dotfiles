    FUNCTION
    namestring  -  get full string form of a pathname

    USAGE
    namestring path

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a string representing PATH.  PATH must be  a  pathname,  string,
    symbol, or stream.  If PATH is a stream, it must be or have been open to
    a file, and the returned file name may need to be submitted to  truename
    to find out the real file name.

    The exact behavior of this  function  is  implementation-dependent,  the
    implementation in turn depending on details of the operating system.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The details of the returned string
    ;;  are implementation-dependent:
    (namestring (make-pathname
                 :host "franz" :device "clroot"
                 :directory :root :name "foo" :type "cl"))
      => "ROOT/foo.cl"
