    FUNCTION
    float-radix  -  get the radix of the representation of a floating-point
      number

    USAGE
    float-radix float

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the radix of the internal representation of FLOAT.   This  value
    is implementation-dependent.  The most common values are 2 and 16.

    A floating-point number may be represented  mathematically  as  S F RE-Q
    where  S  is  the  sign (as returned by float-sign), F is the fractional
    part such that 0 < F RP < RP, R is the radix of the internal representa-
    tion  (as returned by float-radix), E is the exponent, Q is the integral
    excess or bias of the representation, and P is the precision in  radix-R
    digits  of the representation.  For normalized numbers, R-1 < F < 1 or F
    is zero and E is minimal.

    The function decode-float returns F as  its  first  value,  E-Q  as  its
    second  value, and S at its third value, for a normalized floating-point
    number.

    EXAMPLES
    (float-radix 2.8) => 2
    (float-radix 13.0) => 2
