    FUNCTION
    asinh  -  get the hyperbolic arc sine of a number

    USAGE
    asinh number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the hyperbolic arc sine of NUMBER.

    There are two portions to the branch cut for asinh.  One lies along  the
    positive  imaginary  axis  from i (inclusive) to positive infinity, con-
    tinuous with the first quadrant, and the other lies along  the  negative
    imaginary axis from -i (inclusive) to negative infinity, continuous with
    the third quadrant.  The range consists of points in the  complex  plane
    whose  real  part  is between -J/2  (including the end point if the real
    part is non-positive), and J/2 (including the end point if the real part
    is non-negative).

    EXAMPLES
    (asinh 0) => 0.0
    (asinh 1) => 0.8813736
