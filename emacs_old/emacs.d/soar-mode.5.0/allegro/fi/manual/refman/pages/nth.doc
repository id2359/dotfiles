    FUNCTION
    nth  -  get the NTH element of a list

    USAGE
    nth n list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the NTH element of LIST, where N is an integer greater  than  or
    equal  to  zero.   Indexing  is zero-origin, so if N is zero, the car of
    LIST is returned.  If N is greater than or equal to the length of  LIST,
    then nil is returned.

    nth may be used with setf to change an element of a list.  In that case,
    the argument N must be less than the length of the list.

    EXAMPLES
    (nth 2 '(a b c)) => c
    (nth 3 '(a b c)) => nil
    (nth 9 '(a b c)) => nil
    (nth 0 '(a b c)) => a
    (setq lis '(0 1 2 3)) => (0 1 2 3)
    (setf (nth 2 lis) 'c) => (0 1 c 3)
    lis => (0 1 c 3)
