    FUNCTION
    ed  -  invoke the resident editor from lisp

    Usage
    ed [PATHNAME-OR-SYMBOL]

    DESCRIPTION
    Invoke the resident editor, if  there  is  one.   The  return  value  is
    implementation-dependent.   Assuming that there is a resident editor, ed
    called with an argument of nil or without any arguments will resume  the
    editor in the same state in which you last left it.  If a symbol is sup-
    plied as the argument, the code associated with the function represented
    by the symbol is edited, if it is available.  If the argument is a path-
    name or string, ed will edit the contents of the  file  denoted  by  the
    pathname or string.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following invokes the resident editor on
    ;;  the file mydir/foo.l.
    (ed "mydir/foo.l")
