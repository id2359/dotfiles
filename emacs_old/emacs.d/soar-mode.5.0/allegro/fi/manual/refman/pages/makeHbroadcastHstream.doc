    FUNCTION
    make-broadcast-stream  -  make an output stream that sends output to
      several given streams

    USAGE
    make-broadcast-stream {stream}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a stream that acts as a channel, so that all output sent  to  it
    is  merely passed on to all the STREAMS associated with it.  Each STREAM
    must be a stream.  If none are specified, the returned  stream  discards
    any  output  written  to  it.   The  returned stream can only take those
    operations that can be taken by ALL the given  STREAMS.   Any  operation
    that  performed  on  the returned broadcast stream returns the result of
    performing the operation on the last STREAM argument.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq r2 (make-string-output-stream))
    (setq d2 (make-string-output-stream))
    (format (make-broadcast-stream r2 d2) "Hello r2 d2") => nil
    (get-output-stream-string r2) => "Hello r2 d2"
    (get-output-stream-string d2) => "Hello r2 d2"
