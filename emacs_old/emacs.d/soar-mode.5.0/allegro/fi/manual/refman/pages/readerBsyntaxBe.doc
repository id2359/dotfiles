    READER SYNTAX
    \  -  quote next character

    USAGE
    \c

    DESCRIPTION
    When  the  reader  reads  the  single-escape  character  ``\'',  it   is
    discarded,  and  the  reader  reads  the next character as a constituent
    alphabetic character, regardless of  the  character's  normal  syntactic
    type  or reader macro definition.  If it is a lowercase character, it is
    not converted to uppercase.  If the end of file is encountered following
    ``\'', an error is signalled.

    This character is not a macro character.   Processing  of  single-escape
    characters is built into the COMMON LISP reader.

    EXAMPLES
    (read-from-string "a\\(b\\ c\\)") => |A(B C)| 9
    (read-from-string "a\\b\\ c") => |Ab C| 6

    'a\(b\ c\) => |A(B C)|
    'a\b\ c => |Ab C|
