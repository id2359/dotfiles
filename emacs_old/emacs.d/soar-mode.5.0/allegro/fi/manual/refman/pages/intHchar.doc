    FUNCTION
    int-char  -  get the character encoded by an integer

    USAGE
    int-char n

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the character object encoded by N if possible,  and  nil  other-
    wise.   If  int-char  returns  a character, then N, which must be a non-
    negative integer, is equal to the value  of  char-int  applied  to  that
    character.  The value returned by int-char is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    (int-char (char-int #\a)) => #\a
    ;;  The following returned values are implementation-dependent.
    (int-char 97) => #\a
    (int-char 65) => #\A
    (int-char 321) => #\Control-A
    (int-char 65857) => #1\Control-A
