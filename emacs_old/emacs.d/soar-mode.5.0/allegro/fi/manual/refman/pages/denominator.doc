    FUNCTION
    denominator  -  get the denominator of a rational number

    USAGE
    denominator rational

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the denominator of the canonical reduced form of RATIONAL, which
    must  be  a  ratio  or an integer.  If RATIONAL is an integer, then 1 is
    returned.  The denominator of a rational in  canonical  form  is  always
    strictly  positive  (the  sign is carried by the numerator).  The gcd of
    the numerator and denominator of a rational, as  returned  by  numerator
    and denominator, respectively, is always 1.

    EXAMPLES
    (denominator (/ -1 2)) => 2
    (denominator (/ 1 -2)) => 2
    (denominator (/ 12 24)) => 2
    (denominator 4) => 1
