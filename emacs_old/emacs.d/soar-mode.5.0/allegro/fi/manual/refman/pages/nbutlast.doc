    FUNCTION
    nbutlast  -  cut into list, getting all elements except a specified
      number at the end (destructive)

    USAGE
    nbutlast list [n]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    LIST may be modified.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns and modifies LIST so that it contains all but the  last  N  ele-
    ments.   nbutlast changes the cdr of the N+1st cons from the end of LIST
    to nil.  If N is greater than or equal to the number of elements in LIST
    then  nil  is  returned and the argument is unchanged.  N defaults to 1.
    LIST must be a true (not a dotted) list.

    nbutlast returns nil, leaving its LIST  argument  unmodified,  if  N  is
    greater  than or equal to the number of elements in LIST.  Therefore, it
    is advisable to use setq to change the value  of  a  variable  given  to
    nbutlast.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq a '(r s t u v)) => (r s t u v)
    ;;  Since the argument to NBUTLAST may not itself change, you  should
    ;;  use SETQ, as in the following.
    (setq a (nbutlast a)) => (r s t u)
    a => (r s t u)

    (nbutlast '(r s t u v) 5) => nil
    (nbutlast '()) => nil
    (nbutlast '(x)) => nil
