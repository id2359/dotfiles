    FUNCTION
    get-decoded-time  -  get the current time in Decoded Time format

    Usage
    get-decoded-time

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the current time in Decoded Time format.  The nine components of
    Decoded  Time  are SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DATE, MONTH, YEAR, DAY-OF-WEEK,
    DAYLIGHT-SAVINGS-TIME-P, and TIME-ZONE.  SECOND is an integer from 0  to
    59,  as is MINUTE.  HOUR is an integer from 0 to 23.  DATE is an integer
    from 1 to 31, but is not greater than the number of days in  the  month.
    MONTH  is  an  integer  from 1 to 12, with January being 1.  YEAR is the
    absolute year of the Common Era (i.e. AD).  DAY-OF-WEEK is coded from  0
    to 6 with Monday being 0.  TIME-ZONE is in zones west of Greenwich, that
    is the number of hours that standard time in your location is less  than
    GMT.   DAYLIGHT-SAVINGS-TIME-P is t or nil as daylight-saving time is or
    is not currently in EFFECT in your location (not is or is  not  used  in
    your location).

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following time is Saturday, May 28, 1988,
    ;;  1:30:34 PM in California (8 zones west of Greenwich,
    ;;  with daylight-saving time in effect).
    (multiple-value-list (get-decoded-time))
      => (34 30 13 28 5 1988 5 t 8)
