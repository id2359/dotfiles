    FUNCTION
    notevery  -  test whether at least one group of corresponding sequence
      elements fails a test

    Usage
    notevery PRED {SEQUENCES}+

    DESCRIPTION
    This function applies the predicate PRED  to  successive  elements  from
    each  sequence.   PRED must take as many arguments as there are argument
    sequences.  The first application of PRED is to all the  first  elements
    of SEQUENCES.  The second is to all the second elements, and so on.  The
    first time PRED returns false, notevery returns non-nil without  further
    computation.   If  the  end  of any argument sequence is reached without
    PRED returning false, notevery returns nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (notevery #'eq '(1 3 5) '(1 3 6)) => t
    (notevery #'oddp '(1 3 6)) => t
    (notevery #'atom '(a b 1 2 3)) => nil
    (notevery #'> '(7 8 9) '(4 5 6) '(1 2 3 1000)) => nil
