    FUNCTION
    char-upcase  -  convert character to uppercase equivalent

    USAGE
    char-upcase char

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the uppercase version of CHAR  provided  one  exists,  otherwise
    returns  CHAR  itself.  If CHAR, which must be a character object, has a
    different code attribute than the returned character, then  lower-case-p
    is  true  of  CHAR.  The font and bits attributes of CHAR may affect the
    action taken, but will not be changed in the returned character.

    EXAMPLES
    (char-upcase #\a) => #\A
    (char-upcase #\T) => #\T
    (upper-case-p (char-upcase #\a)) => t
