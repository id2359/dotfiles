    FUNCTION
    package-shadowing-symbols  -  get list of shadowing symbols for a pack-
      age

    USAGE
    package-shadowing-symbols package

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a list of all symbols that have been declared  to  be  shadowing
    symbols  in  PACKAGE.   PACKAGE  must  be a package.  A symbol becomes a
    shadowing symbol only by calls  to  shadow  or  shadowing-import.   Such
    calls  may  be  implicit in the way the implementation handles name con-
    flict errors.  All of the symbols  in  the  shadowing-symbols  list  are
    present in PACKAGE.

    All name conflicts with a symbol on this list will be resolved in  favor
    of the shadowing symbol without error or warning.  An error will be sig-
    nalled only if a symbol with the same print name  as  a  symbol  on  the
    shadowing-symbols list is imported with import.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The printed representation of a package object
    ;;  is implementation dependent:
    (or (find-package :geometry) (make-package :geometry))
      => #<the GEOMETRY package, 0 internal, 0 external>
    (shadow 'times :geometry) => t
    (package-shadowing-symbols (find-package :geometry))
      => (geometry::times)
