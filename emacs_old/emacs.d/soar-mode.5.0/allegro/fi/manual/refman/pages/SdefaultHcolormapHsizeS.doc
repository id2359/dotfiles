       VARIABLE
       *default-colormap-size*  -  default value of the SIZE
         argument to create-colormap

       DESCRIPTION
       Evaluates to a number that will be the size of a color-
       map  created  by  create-colormap  if the optional SIZE
       argument to that function is not specified.   The  ini-
       tial  value  of  this  variable is 8, which is also the
       size  of  the  colormap   which   is   the   value   of
       *default-colormap.   The  size of a colormap determines
       how many colors can be stored into it.

       *default-colormap-size* => 8
       (colormap-size (create-colormap)) => 8
