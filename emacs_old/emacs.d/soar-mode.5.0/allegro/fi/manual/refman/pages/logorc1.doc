    FUNCTION
    logorc1  -  bitwise logical `or', complementing the first argument

    USAGE
    logorc1 n1 n2

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `or' of N2 and the complement of  N1.   Both
    arguments must be integers.  Arguments and results are interpreted as if
    represented in two's-complement notation.  The following identity holds:

    (logorc1 x y) = (logior (lognot x) y)

    EXAMPLES
    (logorc1 -3 5) => 7

    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (Since bitwise logical operations interpret integers as
    ;;  half-infinite, the result is negative, which in two's-
    ;;  complement representation has an infinite string of 1's
    ;;  to the right, that is toward higher-order bits.  The
    ;;  number #b-101 would be represented in two's-complement
    ;;  as ...11111011.)
    (logorc1 #b1100 #b1010) => #b-101
    (ldb (byte 4 0) #b-101) => #b1011
    (logbitp 100 #b-101) => t
