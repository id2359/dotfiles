    FUNCTION
    digit-char  -  make a digit character given weight, radix and font

    USAGE
    digit-char weight [radix [font]]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a character object in font FONT that  is  a  digit  representing
    WEIGHT  in radix RADIX provided this is possible, and returns nil other-
    wise.  The arguments must be integers, RADIX defaulting to 10  and  FONT
    defaulting  to  0.  The function digit-char will not return nil when the
    font is zero, the radix is between 2 and 36 inclusive, and the weight is
    non-negative and less than the radix.  Uppercase letters are returned in
    preference to lowercase letters.  Exactly what nonzero  values  of  FONT
    can result in a non-nil returned value is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    (digit-char 9) => #\9
    (digit-char 10) => nil
    (digit-char 10 16) => #\A
    (digit-char 9 8) => nil
