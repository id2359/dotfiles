    FUNCTION
    logbitp  -  test whether a specific bit is 1

    USAGE
    logbitp index n

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if the bit of N of index INDEX is 1, and  false  otherwise.
    The  specified  bit  is  the  one  whose weight is 2 raised to the power
    INDEX.  Both arguments must be integers; INDEX must be non-negative.   N
    is interpreted as if represented in two's-complement notation.  The fol-
    lowing identity holds:

    (logbitp index n) = (ldb-test (byte 1 index) n)

    EXAMPLES
    (logbitp 0 3) => t
    (logbitp 2 3) => nil
    (logbitp 2 5) => t
