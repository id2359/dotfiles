    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~G  -  print floating-point number in fixed-format or exponential nota-
      tion

    USAGE
    ~width,round,ewidth,scale,overflowchar,padchar,echar[@]G

    DESCRIPTION
    Prints the next format argument as a  floating-point  number  in  nonex-
    ponential  or exponential notation, depending on the argument's absolute
    value.  If the argument is a complex number or a non-numeric object, the
    format  ~WIDTHD is used.  If the argument is rational, the value printed
    is of type single-float.  Note that to print the components of a complex
    number  using  this  directive,  the  real  and  imaginary parts must be
    printed separately using ``~G'' twice in the format control string  with
    the real and imaginary parts as separate format arguments.

    For the sake of explanation, let ARG be the absolute value of the format
    argument   to   be   printed,   and  let  N  be  an  integer  such  that
    10N-1 < ARG < 10N (but let N be 0 if ARG is zero).  Now  let  PADEXP  be
    EWIDTH  + 2 if EWIDTH is specified, otherwise let PADEXP be 4.  Then let
    FWIDTH be WIDTH - PADEXP if WIDTH is specified, otherwise let FWIDTH  be
    empty.   If  ROUND  is  unspecified,  define it to be (max Q (min N 7)),
    where Q is the number of digits needed to print  ARG  with  no  loss  of
    information  and without leading or trailing zeros.  Finally, let FROUND
    be ROUND - N.

    If 0 < N < ROUND, then the argument is printed as if with the directive

         ~FWIDTH,FROUND,,OVERFLOWCHAR,PADCHARF~PADEXP@T

    The SCALE and ECHAR parameters are not used in this case.  For all other
    values of N, the argument is printed as if with the directive

         ~WIDTH,ROUND,EWIDTH,OVERFLOWCHAR,PADCHAR,ECHARE

    In all cases an ``@'' modifier is passed to the new directive if  it  is
    used in the original ``~G'' directive.

    EXAMPLES
    (defun gtest (x)
      (format nil "~10,3,2,2@G%~10,2,2,,'x,'>,'^G%~9,3,,-2G"
              x x x x)) => gtest
    (gtest 1234.0)    => "+12.34e+02%>>1.23^+03% 0.001e+6"
    (gtest 0.007E16)  => "+70.00e+12%>>7.00^+13%0.007e+16"
    (gtest 1.23456)   => " +1.23    %>>>1.2    % 1.23    "
    (gtest -1.23456)  => " -1.23    %>>-1.2    %-1.23    "
    (gtest 500.0L123) => "**********%xxxxxxxxxx%.005d+128"
