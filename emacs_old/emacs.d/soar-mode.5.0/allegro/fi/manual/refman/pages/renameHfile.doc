    FUNCTION
    rename-file  -  change the name of a file

    USAGE
    rename-file old-name new-name

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The file identified by OLD-NAME is renamed.

    DESCRIPTION
    Changes the name of the file OLD-NAME to  NEW-NAME,  and  returns  three
    values:    the   result   of   merging   NEW-NAME  with  OLD-NAME  using
    merge-pathnames, the truename  of  OLD-NAME  before  renaming,  and  the
    truename of the new file after renaming.  The argument OLD-NAME must  be
    a pathname, string, or stream, while the argument  NEW-NAME  must  be  a
    pathname or a string.  Neither may contain a :wild component.

    EXAMPLES
    (with-open-file (out "junk" :direction :output
                         :if-exists :supersede)
      (prin1 "my name is junk" out))
    ;;  The printed representation of pathnames
    ;;  is implementation-dependent.
    (multiple-value-list (rename-file "junk" "stuff"))
      => (#p"/usr/dm/stuff" #p"/usr/dm/junk" #p("/usr/dm/stuff")
    (with-open-file (in "stuff" :direction :input)
        (read in)) => "my name is junk"
    (null (probe-file "junk")) => t
