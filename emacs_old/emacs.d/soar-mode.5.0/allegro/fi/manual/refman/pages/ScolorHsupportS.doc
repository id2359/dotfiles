    VARIABLE
    *color-support*  -  type of color display

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to a keyword which tells COMMON WINDOWS  what  type  of  color
    display  you are connected to.  This value is set when COMMON WINDOWS is
    initialized.  There are three  possible  values,  corresponding  to  the
    three  supported  color  systems: :staticgray (for monochrome machines),
    :grayscale (for  gray  level  machines),  and  :pseudocolor  (for  color
    machines).   If your server uses a different type of color support, COM-
    MON WINDOWS may not run properly or may not support colors properly.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  This is the value on a is monochrome machine.
    *color-support* => :staticgray
