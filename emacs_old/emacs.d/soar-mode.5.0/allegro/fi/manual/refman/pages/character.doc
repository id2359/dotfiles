    FUNCTION
    character  -  coerce object to a character

    Usage
    character OBJECT

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a character object equivalent to OBJECT if  possible,  otherwise
    an  error  is  signalled.  If OBJECT is a character, it is returned.  If
    OBJECT is a  string  of  length  1,  the  single  character  element  is
    returned.   If  OBJECT  is  a  symbol  whose print name is a unit-length
    string, the single character element  is  returned.   If  OBJECT  is  an
    integer,  the  value  from  applying int-char to the object is returned.
    (Note that characters cannot  be  coerced  back  to  integers,  although
    char-code  or char-int can be used to explicitly find the integer encod-
    ings.) The mapping between integers and  characters  in  implementation-
    dependent.

    The following identity holds:

    (character x) = (coerce x 'character)

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The returned values are implementation-dependent:
    (character 65) => #\A
    (character 321) => #\control-A
