    FUNCTION
    minusp  -  test whether a number is less than zero

    USAGE
    minusp number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if NUMBER is strictly less than  0,  and  false  otherwise.
    NUMBER  must  be  a  real  number.   If  an  implementation has separate
    representations for positive and negative  zero,  neither  will  satisfy
    this predicate.

    EXAMPLES
    (minusp -0.1) => t
    (minusp -0/5) => nil
    (minusp -3) => t
    (minusp *least-negative-short-float*) => t
