    FUNCTION
    sqrt  -  get the square root of a number

    USAGE
    sqrt number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the principal square root of NUMBER, which may be any number.

    The branch cut for sqrt is continuous with the second quadrant, and lies
    on  the  negative  real  axis.   The  range is the right half-plane, and
    includes the non-negative  imaginary  axis  but  excludes  the  negative
    imaginary axis.

    If NUMBER is a non-negative integer with an integral  square  root,  the
    format  of  the  result  (whether  integer  or  real) is implementation-
    dependent.  Similarly, if NUMBER is a negative  integer  with  a  square
    root  whose  imaginary part is integral, the parts of the complex result
    may be real or rational.

    EXAMPLES
    (sqrt 9.0) => 3.0
    (sqrt -9.0) => #c(0.0 3.0)
    (sqrt 1/4) => 0.5
