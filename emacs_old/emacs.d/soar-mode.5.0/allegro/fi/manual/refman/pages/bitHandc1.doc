    FUNCTION
    bit-andc1  -  perform a bitwise logical `and' on the complement of a bit
      array and another bit array

    USAGE
    bit-andc1 bit-array1 bit-array2 [result-array]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    If RESULT-ARRAY is provided as  an  argument,  then  it  will  hold  the
    results  of  the  logical  operation and thus be modified.  RESULT-ARRAY
    must be a bit array of the same rank and dimensions  as  the  other  two
    arguments.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `and' of the complement  of  BIT-ARRAY1  and
    BIT-ARRAY2.   Both  must  be bit arrays of the same rank and dimensions.
    The result is produced by performing the operation on corresponding ele-
    ments  of  the two arrays.  If the optional argument RESULT-ARRAY is not
    provided, a new bit array is created and returned.  The logical `and' of
    a bit I complemented and a bit J is 1 if and only if I is 0 and J is 1.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  #* is the reader macro for bit vectors.
    (setq bit-arr (make-array 4 :element-type 'bit))
    (bit-andc1 #*1100 #*1010 bit-arr) => #*0010
    bit-arr => #*0010
