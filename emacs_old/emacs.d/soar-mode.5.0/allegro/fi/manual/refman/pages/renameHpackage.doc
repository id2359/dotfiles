    FUNCTION
    rename-package  -  change the name of a package

    USAGE
    rename-package package new-name [new-nicknames]

    SIDE EFFECTS

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the new name after replacing the old package name and all of its
    nicknames with NEW-NAME and NEW-NICKNAMES.  The argument PACKAGE must be
    a package.  The argument NEW-NAME must either be a string  or  a  symbol
    (in  which  case  the  symbol's  print name will be used).  Finally, the
    argument NEW-NICKNAMES, which defaults to nil, must be a list of strings
    or symbols.  These will denote aliases for the newly named package.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq *pack* (or (find-package :geometry)
                     (make-package :geometry)))
    (rename-package *pack* :geology)
    (package-name *pack* ) => GEOLOGY

    ;; We forgot to specify the nickname.
    (rename-package (find-package :geology) :geology '(rocks))
    (package-nicknames (find-package :geology)) => ("ROCKS")
