    FUNCTION
    both-case-p  -  test whether a character object comes in uppercase and
      lowercase

    USAGE
    both-case-p char

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if CHAR, which must be a character object, is an  uppercase
    (lowercase)  letter  with  a corresponding lowercase (uppercase) letter,
    and false otherwise.  The characters #\a through #\z are lowercase,  and
    the characters #\A through #\Z are uppercase.  In theory, a letter (of a
    non-Roman font, for example) may be neither lowercase nor uppercase.   A
    character with a nonzero bits attribute is never both-case-p.

    EXAMPLES
    (both-case-p #\a) => t
    (both-case-p #\newline) => nil
    (both-case-p #\T) => t
    (both-case-p #\control-X) => nil
