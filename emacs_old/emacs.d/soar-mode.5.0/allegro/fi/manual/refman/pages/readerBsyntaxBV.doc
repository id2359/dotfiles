    READER SYNTAX
    |  -  quote delimited characters

    Usage
    |...|

    DESCRIPTION
    When the  reader  reads  the  multiple-escape  character  ``|'',  it  is
    discarded,  and the reader continues to accumulate succeeding characters
    for the current token, but it treats all characters as constituent char-
    acters  except the single-escape character ``\'' and the multiple-escape
    character ``|''.  If the single-escape character ``\'' is  read,  it  is
    discarded,  and the next character is accumulated.  If a multiple-escape
    character ``|'' is read, it is discarded, and normal character syntax is
    again observed by the reader.

    This character is not a macro character.  Processing of  multiple-escape
    characters  is  built into the COMMON LISP reader.  Note that ``|'' does
    not terminate a token.

    EXAMPLES
    (read-from-string "a|(b c)|") => |A(b c)| 8
    (read-from-string "a|b |c") => |Ab C| 6

    'a|(b c)| => |A(b c)|
    'a|b |c => |Ab C|
