    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~{  -  process control string repetitively

    USAGE
    ~count[:][@]&EOBRCstring~[:]&ECBRC

    DESCRIPTION
    Repeatedly processes STRING as a format control string  provided  it  is
    not  empty,  otherwise  the next argument is used as STRING.  Processing
    terminates when an iteration step begins for which there are no  remain-
    ing  arguments  or  if COUNT is specified and COUNT iterations have been
    done.  If ``~:}'' ends the directive instead of ``~}'' and COUNT is  not
    specified as zero, then STRING is processed at least once, even if there
    are no arguments.

    The arguments may be taken from a list  specified  as  the  next  format
    argument  or  from  a  list consisting of the remaining arguments at the
    current level, depending on the ``:'' and ``@'' modifiers  given.   Each
    iteration  step  uses  up as many of these arguments as would be used in
    processing STRING just once.  If no modifiers are given, the next  argu-
    ment  should be a list of arguments to be processed as if by a recursive
    call to format.

    If ``~:{'' starts the directive, the next argument should be a  list  of
    sublists.   Upon  each iteration, arguments are taken from the next sub-
    list, regardless of whether there are any unprocessed arguments  remain-
    ing  on  the  previous  sublist.   If  ``~@{'' starts the directive, the
    remaining arguments at the current level  are  used.   The  features  of
    ``~:{'' and ``~@{'' are combined when ``~:@{'' starts the directive.  In
    this case the remaining arguments at the current level are used as  sub-
    lists.

    This directive must nest properly with respect to other  format  control
    structure  directives.   The  ``~^''  directive may be used to terminate
    processing prematurely.

    EXAMPLES
    (format nil "~{ ~A = ~D~}" '(x 1 y 3 z 4))
      => " x = 1 y = 3 z = 4"
    (format nil "~2:@{ ~A = ~D~}" '(x 5 1) '(y 3) '(z 4))
      => " x = 5 y = 3"
