    FUNCTION
    ldiff  -  get that part of a list preceding a sublist

    USAGE
    ldiff list sublist

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a new list containing only the initial elements of a given list.
    The  SUBLIST  argument is used to prune trailing elements from the argu-
    ment LIST.  Both arguments must be lists.  Neither argument is modified.

    If SUBLIST is nil, a copy of LIST is returned (as if by copy-list).   If
    SUBLIST  is  a  tail  of  LIST,  those  elements of LIST not in its tail
    SUBLIST are collected into the returned list in the order they appear in
    LIST.   Thus  the returned list is a copy of LIST less its tail SUBLIST.
    A sublist is a tail  of  another  list  if  it  satisfies  tailp,  which
    requires that the sublist be eq to one of the conses that form the list.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq a '(m n o p q r)) => (m n o p q r)
    (setq b (cddr a)) => (o p q r)
    (ldiff a b) => (m n)
    (ldiff a '(o p q r)) => (m n o p q r)
