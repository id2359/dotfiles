    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~C  -  print character

    USAGE
    ~[:][@]C

    DESCRIPTION
    Prints the next format argument, which should be a character object,  in
    an implementation-dependent way according to the modifiers.

    ~C   Prints in a short format `culturally compatible' with the implemen-
         tation environment.

    ~:C  Prints in a pretty format, spelling out names of control  bits  and
         nonprinting characters.

    ~@C  Prints using the ``#\'' notation understood by read.

    ~:@C Prints just as ~:C but may add information on generating the  char-
         acter object from the keyboard in use.

    EXAMPLES
    (format nil "~C ~:C ~@C" #\c-m-X #\c-m-X #\c-m-X)
      => "C-M-X Control-Meta-X #\Control-Meta-X"
    (format nil "Enter ~:@C now." #\control-meta-X)
      => "Enter Control-Meta-X now."
