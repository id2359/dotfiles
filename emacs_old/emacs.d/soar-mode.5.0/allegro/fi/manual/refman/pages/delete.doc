    FUNCTION
    delete  -  change a sequence by deleting items from it (destructive)

    Usage
    delete ITEM SEQUENCE [:key KEYFNC] [:count CNT] [:from-end FE] [{:test |
      :test-not} PRED] [:key KEYFNC] [:start SN] [:end EN]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The argument SEQUENCE may be changed.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns SEQUENCE after removing every element eql to ITEM.  This is  the
    destructive version of remove.  (Note that, depending on the implementa-
    tion, SEQUENCE itself may be returned, after  being  modified,  SEQUENCE
    may  be  modified  and  another  sequence  returned,  or SEQUENCE may be
    unchanged and another sequence returned.)

    Specifying an integer value for the :count  keyword  argument  restricts
    the  number of items removed.  No more than that number of elements will
    be deleted.

    A test predicate other than eql may be used by specifying  PRED  as  the
    value  of either the :test or the :test-not keyword argument.  PRED must
    be a function that  accepts  two  arguments  (ITEM  and  an  element  of
    SEQUENCE,  passed  in  that order).  If PRED is the value of :test, ITEM
    and the element match if PRED returns true.  If PRED  is  the  value  of
    :test-not,  ITEM  and the element match if PRED returns false.  It is an
    error to supply both :test and :test-not keyword arguments.

    If the keyword argument :key is specified and its value  KEYFNC  is  not
    nil,  KEYFNC  must  be a function that accepts one argument.  It will be
    applied to each element of SEQUENCE before that element is tested.  When
    unspecified or nil, it effectively defaults to the function identity.

    If the :from-end keyword argument is specified non-nil, SEQUENCE is pro-
    cessed in the reverse direction.  This argument defaults to nil.  It can
    affect the result only if used in conjunction with :count.

    To operate on a subsequence of SEQUENCE, specify  the  :start  and  :end
    keyword  arguments.   The :start keyword argument indicates the index of
    the first element of the subsequence to examine.  Its value defaults  to
    zero  (indicating  the first element).  The :end keyword argument speci-
    fies an index one greater than the index of the last element to examine.
    A value of nil is equivalent to the default, the length of the sequence.
    If SEQUENCE is a vector with a fill pointer, only the active elements of
    SEQUENCE can be deleted.

    EXAMPLES
    (delete 'a '(a b c)) => (b c)
    (delete '(a) '((a) b c)) => ((a) b c)
    (delete '(a) '((a) b c) :test  #'equal) => (b c)
    (delete 'a '((a) (b) (c)) :key #'car) => ((b) (c))
    (delete 'a '(a b c a b c a) :count 2) => (b c b c a)
    (delete 'a '(a b c a b c a) :count 2 :from-end t)
      => (a b c b c)
    (delete 'a '(a b c a b c a) :start 0 :end 5)
      => (b c b c a)
