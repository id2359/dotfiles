    KEYWORD ARGUMENT
    :displaced-to  -  map accesses to one array onto another

    USAGE
    :displaced-to destination-array

    DESCRIPTION
    This keyword option may be used with either make-array or  adjust-array.
    It  indicates  that  accesses to the array that is being created will be
    mapped onto the array DESTINATION-ARRAY.  Usually another keyword  argu-
    ment,  :displaced-index-offset  will  be provided, but if it is not then
    its value defaults to 0.  Suppose that the array being created is called
    NEW-ARRAY.   Accesses  to  NEW-ARRAY  are  computed  by enumerating both
    NEW-ARRAY and DESTINATION-ARRAY in row-major order so that the ITH  ele-
    ment  of NEW-ARRAY maps onto the element of DESTINATION-ARRAY indexed by
    the sum of I and DISPLACED-INDEX-OFFSET.

    When this keyword argument is used with the function  adjust-array,  the
    original contents of the array being adjusted are lost.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq A (make-array '(2 3)
                        :adjustable t
                        :initial-contents '((a b c)(d e f))))
      => #2a((a b c) (d e f))
    (setq B (make-array '(2 3) :displaced-to A))
    (setf (aref B 0 1) 'z) => z
    A => #2a((a z c) (d e f))
    B => #2a((a z c) (d e f))
