    FUNCTION
    member-if-not  -  test whether each element of a list does not satisfy a
      test

    USAGE
    member-if-not pred list [:key keyfnc]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the tail of LIST starting with the first element not  satisfying
    the predicate PRED if such an element exists, and nil if no such element
    is found.  PRED must accept one argument.  Only the top level of LIST is
    searched.  If a tail is returned, it is eq to that part of LIST starting
    with the element found, and so shares storage with LIST.

    If the keyword argument :key is specified and its value  KEYFNC  is  not
    nil,  KEYFNC  must  be a function that accepts one argument.  It will be
    applied to every element of LIST before that element  is  tested.   When
    unspecified or nil, it effectively defaults to the function identity.

    EXAMPLES
    (member-if-not #'atom '(a b c (d) (e f))) => ((d) (e f))
    (member-if-not #'symbolp '((a) (b) (3) (4))) => ((a) (b) (3) (4))
    (member-if-not #'symbolp '((a) (b) (3) (4)) :key #'car)
      => ((3) (4))
