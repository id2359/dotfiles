    FUNCTION
    princ  -  output representation of an object to a stream without escape
      characters

    Usage
    princ OBJECT [STREAM]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A representation of OBJECT without any escape characters is  written  to
    STREAM.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns OBJECT, but this function is used for its  side  effects.   This
    function  differs from prin1 in that no escape characters are output and
    the printed representation may not necessarily be acceptable to read  or
    read  back as an equal object.  That is, this function effectively binds
    *print-escape* to false when outputting the  printed  representation  of
    OBJECT.  The following code equivalence holds:

    (princ object stream) = (write object :stream stream :escape nil)

    The argument STREAM may be a stream which accepts output, or STREAM  may
    be  t  or  nil.   If STREAM is nil, output will go to *standard-output*,
    which is also the default value if STREAM is not specified.   If  STREAM
    is t, output goes to *terminal-io*.

    EXAMPLES
    (prin1 "this is a test") => "this is a test"
      PRINTS "this is a test"
    (princ "this is a test") => "this is a test"
      PRINTS this is a test
    (prin1 #\newline) => #\newline
      PRINTS #\newline
    (princ #\newline) => #\newline

    ;;  A new line is printed.
