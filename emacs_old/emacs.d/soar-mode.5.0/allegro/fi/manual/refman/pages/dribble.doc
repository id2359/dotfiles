    FUNCTION
    dribble  -  record an interactive COMMON LISP session in a file

    Usage
    dribble [PATHNAME]

    DESCRIPTION
    With an argument, subsequent interaction with the COMMON LISP system  is
    recorded  in  the  file  specified by PATHNAME (which may be a pathname,
    string, symbol, or stream).  Recording is stopped and the  the  file  is
    closed  when  dribble is evaluated again with no argument.  What dribble
    returns is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    Here is how dribble works in one implementation:
    <cl> (DRIBBLE "FOO")
    dribbling to file "/usr/tech/dm/foo"
    nil
    <cl> (FORMAT T "HELLO")
    hello
    nil
    <cl> (DRIBBLE)
    Dribble file /usr/tech/dm/foo closed
    <cl>

    Now the file foo contains:

    dribbling to file "/usr/tech/dm/foo" nil <cl> (format t  "hello")  hello
    nil <cl> (dribble)
