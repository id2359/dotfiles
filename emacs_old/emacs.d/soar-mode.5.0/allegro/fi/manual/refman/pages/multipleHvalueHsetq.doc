    MACRO
    multiple-value-setq  -  set a list of variables to multiple values re-
      turned by a form

    USAGE
    multiple-value-setq varlist form

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The values or bindings of the variables in VARLIST are set, in order, to
    the  values  returned  by  evaluating FORM.  Excess variables are set to
    nil.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the first value produced by FORM or nil, if FORM does  not  pro-
    duce  any  values.   VARLIST,  which is not evaluated, must be a list of
    symbols naming variables.  If  there  are  more  variables  than  values
    returned  by  FORM,  the  excess variables are set to nil.  If there are
    more values than variables, the excess values are discarded.

    The values or bindings of the variables are set to the values  resulting
    from   the   evaluation   of  FORM.   No  bindings  are  established  by
    multiple-value-setq.

    EXAMPLES
    (multiple-value-setq (quotient remainder)
      (floor 14 -4))
    quotient => -4
    remainder => -2
