    FUNCTION
    graphic-char-p  -  test whether a character is a graphic character

    USAGE
    graphic-char-p char

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if CHAR, which must be a character  object,  is  a  graphic
    (printing)  character,  and false otherwise.  The set of graphic charac-
    ters consists of any character of type  standard-char  except  #\Newline
    (but including #\Space).  Any character whose bits component is non-zero
    is not considered a graphic character.  All graphic characters print  as
    a single glyph.

    EXAMPLES
    (graphic-char-p #\a) => t
    (graphic-char-p #\Newline) => nil
    (graphic-char-p #\Tab) => nil
    (graphic-char-p #\Space) => t
