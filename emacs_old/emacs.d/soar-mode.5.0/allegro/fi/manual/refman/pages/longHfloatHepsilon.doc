    CONSTANT
    long-float-epsilon  -  smallest distinguishable long-float increment

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the value of the smallest positive long-float number that can be
    added  to  1  to  produce  a  value  distinct from 1.  The value of this
    constant is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The returned value is implementation-dependent.
    long-float-epsilon => 2.220446049250313d-16
