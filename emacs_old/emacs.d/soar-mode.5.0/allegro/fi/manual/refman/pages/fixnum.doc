    Type SPECIFIER
    fixnum  -  the data type comprising `small' integers

    USAGE
    fixnum

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a subtype of integer.  fixnum consists of a range of  integers
    that are efficient to represent.  The range is implementation-dependent,
    but integers of type fixnum are of smaller magnitude than those of  type
    bignum,  as  the  names imply.  fixnum and bignum are mutually exclusive
    subtypes of integer.

    The printed representation of a  fixnum  is  the  same  as  the  printed
    representation  of  any integer, an optional radix-specifier a sign, and
    digits  with  no  spaces.   (The   radix-specifier   is   printed   when
    *print-radix*  is non-nil.) What characters qualify as digits depends on
    the radix.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following results are implementation-dependent (but
    ;;  probably correct in all implementations).
    (typep 999999999999999999 'fixnum) => nil
    (typep 3 'fixnum) => t
