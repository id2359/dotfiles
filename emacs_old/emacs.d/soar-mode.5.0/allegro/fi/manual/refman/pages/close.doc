    FUNCTION
    close  -  close a stream

    USAGE
    close stream [:abort abortp]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    No subsequent input or output operations on  STREAM  are  possible.   If
    ABORTP  is  non-nil, side effects associated with the creation of STREAM
    may be reversed (for example, a file created along with  STREAM  may  be
    removed).

    DESCRIPTION
    Causes STREAM, which must be a stream, to be closed,  and  returns  nil.
    If  a non-nil value is supplied for the :abort keyword argument, this is
    an indication that the stream is being closed abnormally and the  system
    tries  to  clean up any side effects of opening STREAM.  It is permitted
    to close a stream that is already closed.  It may be possible to inquire
    about the stream after it is closed.

    EXAMPLES
    (close *debug-io*) => nil

    ;;  The error is due to the attempt to perform
    ;;  an I/O operation on the closed stream:
    (read *debug-io*) => ERROR
