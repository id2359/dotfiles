    MACRO
    return  -  Return from a block named nil

    USAGE
    return  [result]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    Causes a return from  a  block  named  nil  and  determines  the  values
    returned by the block.

    DESCRIPTION
    Does not return anything itself.  The values returned from the block are
    either  the  results  of  evaluating  RESULT, or the single value nil if
    RESULT is not specified.  The return form must be lexically enclosed  in
    a  block  named  nil.   do,  do*,  do-all-symbols,  do-external-symbols,
    dolist, do-symbols, dotimes, loop, prog, and  prog*  each  automatically
    establish  a  block named nil.  To return from a block with a name other
    than nil, use return-from.  The following forms are equivalent:

    (return x) = (return-from nil x)

    EXAMPLES
    (dolist (x '(1 2 3)) (if (evenp x) (return x))) => 2
    (dolist (x '(1 2 3)) (if (floatp x) (return x))) => nil
