    VARIABLE
    *read-default-float-format*  -  specify the type that will be assumed
      when reading floating-point numbers

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to a type specifier indicating the default float format.  This
    variable  determines  the  format of floating-point numbers read without
    exponent markers or read with either e or  E  as  the  exponent  marker.
    This  variable also determines the exponent marker that the printer uses
    when printing floating-point numbers.  If the floating-point  number  to
    be  printed  has  the  same  format as the value of this variable, it is
    printed with an e or E exponent marker..

    The initial value of this variable is the  symbol  single-float.   Other
    allowable   values   are  the  symbols  short-float,  double-float,  and
    long-float.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Note that if a number is not of the default format, its exponent
    ;;  marker is preserved by the printer.  Whether the default
    ;;  exponent marker is preserved is implementation-dependent.
    *read-default-float-format* => single-float
    5.0d0 => 5.0d0
    5.0f0 => 5.0
    5.0e0 => 5.0

    (setq *read-default-float-format* 'double-float)
    5.0d0 => 5.0
    5.0f0 => 5.0f0
    5.0e0 => 5.0
