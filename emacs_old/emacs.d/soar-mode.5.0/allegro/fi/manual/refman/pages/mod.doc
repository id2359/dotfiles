    Type SPECIFIER
    mod  -  specifies a type comprising non-negative integers that are less
      than some number

    Usage
    (mod N)

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a data type consisting of non-negative integers less  than  N,
    which  must  be  an  integer.   The  type specifiers (integer 0 N-1) and
    (integer 0 (N)) are equivalent to (mod N).

    EXAMPLES
    (typep 8 '(mod 9)) => t
    (typep 9 '(mod 9)) => nil
    (subtypep '(mod 19) '(integer * (20))) => t t
