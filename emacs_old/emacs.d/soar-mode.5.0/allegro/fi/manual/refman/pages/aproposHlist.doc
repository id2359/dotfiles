    FUNCTION
    apropos-list  -  get a list of all symbols whose print name contains a
      specified string

    Usage
    apropos-list STRING [PACKAGE]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a list of all symbols whose print names contain STRING as a sub-
    string.  The argument STRING is normally a string but also may be a sym-
    bol.  In that case its print name is used as the string  which  will  be
    compared with other symbols' print names.

    If you specify PACKAGE then only those symbols accessible in that  pack-
    age  will  be searched.  Since symbols may be available in a package via
    different inheritance paths, a symbol may appear more than once  in  the
    list.   If  PACKAGE  is not specified or is nil, then all symbols (as in
    do-all-symbols) are looked at.  PACKAGE must be a package or nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (apropos-list 'keyword (find-package :lisp))
      => (lambda-list-keywords keywordp keyword)
