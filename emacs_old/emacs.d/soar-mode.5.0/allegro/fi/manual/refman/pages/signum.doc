    FUNCTION
    signum  -  get the sign of a number

    USAGE
    signum number

    DESCRIPTION
    For a non-complex NUMBER, returns zero if the number  is  zero,  one  if
    NUMBER  is  positive, and minus one if NUMBER is negative.  The returned
    value is of the same LISP type as NUMBER.  For a complex-valued  NUMBER,
    this  function  returns a complex number with the same phase but of unit
    magnitude with components of the same floating-point type  as  those  of
    NUMBER.   (If NUMBER is a complex rational, the result will be a complex
    single float.)

    The following identity holds:

    (signum number) =
       (if (zerop number) number (/ number (abs number)))

    EXAMPLES
    (signum -5) => -1
    (signum 2/3) => 1
    (signum #c(7.5 10.0)) => #c(0.6 0.8)
