    MACRO
    untrace  -  turn off tracing of one or more functions

    Usage
    untrace {FUNCTION-NAME}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Return value is implementation-dependent.  Tracing  is  turned  off  for
    each   of   the   functions   named  in  FUNCTION-NAMES.   None  of  the
    FUNCTION-NAMES is evaluated.  If you don't specify any  function  names,
    then  tracing  is  turned off on all currently traced functions.  If you
    invoke untrace on an untraced function  you  might  (depending  on  your
    implementation)  get  a  warning  message,  but  no harmful side effects
    should occur.

    Note that the format and to some extent the content of the trace  output
    is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The exact format of TRACE output is implementation-dependent.
    <cl> (defun foo (x y)
           (+ (* 2 x) y))
    foo
    <cl> (trace foo)
    (foo)
    <cl> (foo 3 4)
     0: (foo 3 4)
     0: returned 10
    10
    <cl> (untrace foo)
    (foo)
    <cl> (foo 3 4)
    10
