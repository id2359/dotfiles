    FUNCTION
    length  -  get the number of elements in a sequence

    Usage
    length SEQUENCE

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns, as an integer, the number of elements in SEQUENCE.  If SEQUENCE
    is  a vector with a fill pointer, length returns the active length, that
    is, the number of elements before the fill pointer.  If  SEQUENCE  is  a
    circular  list, length may not (depending on the implementation) return.
    (list-length, which works only on lists, is guaranteed  to  return  when
    passed a circular list.)

    EXAMPLES
    (length '(a b c d)) => 4
    (length (make-array 10 :fill-pointer 6)) => 6
