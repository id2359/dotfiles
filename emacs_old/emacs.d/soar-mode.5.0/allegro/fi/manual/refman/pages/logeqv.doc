    FUNCTION
    logeqv  -  bitwise logical equivalence (`exclusive nor')

    USAGE
    logeqv {n}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical equivalence  (or  `exclusive  nor')  of  its
    arguments, all of which must be integers. If no arguments are specified,
    -1 is returned.  -1 is the identity for this  function.   Arguments  and
    results are interpreted as if represented in two's-complement notation.

    EXAMPLES
    (logeqv) => -1
    (logeqv 1) => 1
    (logeqv -1 5) => 5

    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (Since bitwise logical operations interpret integers as
    ;;  half-infinite, the result is negative, which in two's-
    ;;  complement representation has an infinite string of 1's
    ;;  to the right, that is toward higher-order bits.  The
    ;;  number #b-111 would be represented in two's-complement
    ;;  as ...111111001.)
    (logeqv #b1100 #b1010) => #b-111
