    FUNCTION
    remove-if-not  -  remove all elements that do not satisfy a test from a
      copy of a sequence

    Usage
    remove-if-not PRED SEQUENCE [:key KEYFNC] [:count CNT] [:from-end FE]
      [:start SN] [:end EN]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a copy of SEQUENCE from which all elements  not  satisfying  the
    predicate  PRED  have been removed.  An element does not satisfy PRED if
    PRED returns false when applied to the element.  PRED  must  accept  one
    argument.

    Specifying an integer value for the :count  keyword  argument  restricts
    the  number of items removed.  No more than that number of elements will
    be deleted.

    If the keyword argument :key is specified and its value  KEYFNC  is  not
    nil,  KEYFNC  must  be a function that accepts one argument.  It will be
    applied to each element of SEQUENCE before that element is tested.  When
    unspecified or nil, it effectively defaults to the function identity.

    If the :from-end keyword argument is specified non-nil, SEQUENCE is pro-
    cessed  in the reverse direction.  The default value of this argument is
    nil.  This argument affects the result only if used in conjunction  with
    :count.

    To operate on a subsequence of SEQUENCE, specify  the  :start  and  :end
    keyword  arguments.   The :start keyword argument indicates the index of
    the first element of the subsequence to examine.  Its value defaults  to
    zero  (indicating  the first element).  The :end keyword argument speci-
    fies an index one greater than the index of the last element to examine.
    A value of nil is equivalent to the default, the length of the sequence.
    If SEQUENCE is a vector with a fill pointer, only the active elements of
    SEQUENCE can be examined.

    EXAMPLES
    (remove-if-not #'numberp '(1 2 3 d 5)) => (1 2 3 5)
    (remove-if-not #'numberp '((1) (2) (3) (d) (5)) :key #'car)
      => ((1) (2) (3) (5))
    (remove-if-not #'evenp '(1 2 3 4 5 6) :count 2) => (2 4 5 6)
    (remove-if-not #'oddp '(1 2 3 4 5 6) :count 2 :from-end t)
      => (1 2 3 5)
    (remove-if-not #'evenp '(1 2 3 4 5 6) :start 0 :end 4)
      => (2 4 5 6)
