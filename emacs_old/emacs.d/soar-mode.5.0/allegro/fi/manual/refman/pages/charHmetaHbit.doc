    CONSTANT
    char-meta-bit  -  weight of the meta bit of characters

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to the integer weight assigned to the meta  bit  of  the  bits
    attribute  of character objects.  An implementation need not support the
    meta bit.  If it does, the value of this constant is 2.  If it does not,
    the value is 0.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following result is implementation-dependent:
    char-meta-bit => 2
