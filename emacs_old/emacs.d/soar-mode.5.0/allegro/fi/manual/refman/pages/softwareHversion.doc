    FUNCTION
    software-version  -  get the version of any relevant supporting software

    Usage
    software-version

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the string identifying the version of  the  supporting  software
    relevant  to  the  Common Lisp you are running.  If no appropriate value
    can be found, it  will  return  nil.   The  precise  value  returned  is
    implementation-dependent.  Typically, the string returned identifies the
    version of the `operating system' on top of which the  LISP  implementa-
    tion is running.

    EXAMPLES
    (software-version) => "V5.0"
