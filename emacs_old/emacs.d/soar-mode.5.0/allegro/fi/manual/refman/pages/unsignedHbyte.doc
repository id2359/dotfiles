    Type SPECIFIER
    unsigned-byte  -  specify a subtype of non-negative integers a given
      number of bits wide

    USAGE
    {unsigned-byte | (&Eunsigned-byte [n])}

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a data type consisting of non-negative integers  that  can  be
    stored  in two's-complement form in N bits.  If K equals 2 raised to the
    power N, then this type specifier is equivalent to (mod K) or (integer 0
    K-1).   The  type specifiers (unsigned-byte *) or just unsigned-byte are
    equivalent to (integer 0 *), which is just the non-negative integers.

    EXAMPLES
    (typep #B1010 '(unsigned-byte 3)) => nil
    (typep #B1010 '(unsigned-byte 5)) => t
