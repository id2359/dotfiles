    FUNCTION
    char-greaterp  -  test whether given characters are monotonically de-
      creasing, ignoring case and bits

    USAGE
    char-greaterp {char}+

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if each CHAR is greater than the next argument CHAR  speci-
    fied and returns nil otherwise.  char-greaterp ignores case and any bits
    attributes and takes font attributes into account in an  implementation-
    dependent  way.   Each CHAR must be a character object.  The ordering on
    characters obeys alphabetic ordering within letters, and numeric  order-
    ing  within  the  digits  0  through 9.  Digits are not interleaved with
    letters, but whether a digit is less  than  or  greater  than  a  letter
    depends on the implementation.

    EXAMPLES
    (char-greaterp #\b #\b) => nil
    (char-greaterp #\d #\c) => t
    (char-greaterp #\b) => t
    (char-greaterp #\B #\b) => nil
    (char-greaterp #\b #\B) => nil

    ;;  The following result is implementation-dependent:
    (char-greaterp #\a #\1) => t
