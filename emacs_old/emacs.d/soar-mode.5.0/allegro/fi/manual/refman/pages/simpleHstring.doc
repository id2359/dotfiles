    Type SPECIFIER
    simple-string  -  the data type comprising simple strings

    USAGE
    {simple-string | (&Esimple-string [size])}

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a data type consisting of simple strings of length SIZE, which
    may   be  explicitly  unspecified  using  *.   This  type  specifier  is
    equivalent to (simple-array string-char (SIZE)).  An array is  a  simple
    array if it has no fill pointer, is not adjustable, and is not displaced
    to another array.

    Strings and bit vectors are two specialized  arrays  provided  by  every
    implementation.

    EXAMPLES
    (type-of "foo") => (simple-array string-char (3))
    (typep "hello" '(simple-string 5)) => t
    (subtypep '(simple-string 100) '(string *)) => t t
