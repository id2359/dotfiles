    FUNCTION
    lognot  -  bitwise logical `not'

    USAGE
    lognot n

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `not' of its  argument,  which  must  be  an
    integer.  The  argument and the result are interpreted as if represented
    in two's-complement notation.

    EXAMPLES
    (lognot 2) => -3

    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (Since bitwise logical operations interpret integers as
    ;;  half-infinite, the result is negative, which in two's-
    ;;  complement representation has an infinite string of 1's
    ;;  to the right, that is toward higher-order bits.  The
    ;;  number #b-110 would be represented in two's-complement
    ;;  as ...11111010.)
    (lognot #b0101) => #b-110
    (ldb (byte 4 0) #b-110) => #b1010
    (logbitp 100 #b-110) => t
