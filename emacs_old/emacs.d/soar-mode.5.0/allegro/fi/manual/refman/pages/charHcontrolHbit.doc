    CONSTANT
    char-control-bit  -  weight of the control bit

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to the integer weight assigned to the control bit of the  bits
    attribute  of character objects. An implementation need not support this
    particular bit. If it is supported, the value is 1.  If it is  not  sup-
    ported, the value is 0.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The returned value is implementation-dependent:
    char-control-bit => 1
