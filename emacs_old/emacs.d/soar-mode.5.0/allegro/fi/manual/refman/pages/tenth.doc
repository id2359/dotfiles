    FUNCTION
    tenth  -  get the tenth element of a list

    USAGE
    tenth list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the tenth element of LIST, where the car of LIST  is  considered
    to be the first element.  LIST must be a list.

    Unlike the nth function, which uses zero-origin indexing, this  function
    uses  one-origin indexing.  If the list has fewer than ten elements, nil
    is returned.  setf may be used with tenth to replace the  tenth  element
    of a list.

    EXAMPLES
    (tenth '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => j
    (tenth '(a)) => nil
    (setq lis '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => (a b c d e f g h i j)
    (setf (tenth lis) 10) => 10
    lis => (a b c d e f g h i 10)
