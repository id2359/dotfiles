    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~X  -  print integer in hexadecimal radix

    USAGE
    ~mincol,padchar,commachar[:][@]X

    DESCRIPTION
    Prints the next format argument in hexadecimal (base 16)  if  it  is  an
    integer, and in ``~A'' format with hexadecimal base (if applicable) oth-
    erwise.  The sign is not printed unless the number is  negative  or  the
    ``@'' modifier is given.

    The prefix parameter MINCOL (default 0) specifies that enough copies  of
    the  padding  character,  PADCHAR (default the space character `` '') be
    added to the beginning of the output string to make it consume at  least
    MINCOL  columns.   If  the  ``:''  modifier  is  given,  the  character,
    COMMACHAR (default ``,'') appears between every three digits.

    EXAMPLES
    (format nil "Enter ~X now." 12) => "Enter c now."
    (format nil "Enter ~X now." '(a b)) => "Enter (a b) now."
    (format nil "Enter ~6X now." -15) => "Enter     -f now."
    (format nil "Enter ~5,' X now." 4095) => "Enter   fff now."
