    FUNCTION
    stream-element-type  -  get the type of object that may be read from, or
      written to, a stream

    USAGE
    stream-element-type stream

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a type specifier indicating the kinds of  objects  that  can  be
    read from, or written to, STREAM, which must be a stream.  In principle,
    streams can handle any LISP object, but streams created with open or any
    other  standard  COMMON  LISP function handle only objects that are sub-
    types of character or integer.  (Different  implementations  may  extend
    stream creation functions to handle other types of object.)

    EXAMPLES
    (stream-element-type *standard-input*) => string-char
    (stream-element-type (make-string-output-stream)) => string-char
    (stream-element-type (open "foo" :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8)))
      => (unsigned-byte 8)
