    FUNCTION
    round  -  round a number to the nearest integer

    USAGE
    round number [divisor]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns two values, Q and R.  Q is the integer result  of  rounding  the
    quotient  of NUMBER and DIVISOR.  R is the difference between NUMBER and
    Q times DIVISOR.  That is

    r = NUMBER - q*DIVISOR

    The result of rounding a number is the integer closest in value  to  the
    number.   If  a number is equidistant between two integers (that is, has
    fractional part 0.5 exactly), the result is the nearest even integer.

    If DIVISOR is not specified, it defaults to 1, so the  first  result  is
    NUMBER rounded.

    The format of the second returned value follows the rules  of  floating-
    point  contagion.  Therefore, the second value may be an integer if both
    of the arguments are integers.

    Both arguments must  be  real  numbers,  either  integer,  rational,  or
    floating-point.

    EXAMPLES
    (round .99) => 1 -0.001
    (round -1.5) => -2 0.5
    (round 3 2) => 2 -1
