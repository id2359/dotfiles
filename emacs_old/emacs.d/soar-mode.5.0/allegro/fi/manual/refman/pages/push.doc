    MACRO
    push  -  push an object onto the front of a list (destructive)

    USAGE
    push item place

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The argument PLACE is changed.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the value stored in the location specified  by  the  generalized
    variable  PLACE  with the arbitrary object ITEM consed onto the front of
    it.  The form PLACE may be any generalized variable acceptable  to  setf
    that  contains  a list.  The value at PLACE is modified.  Any subform of
    PLACE is evaluated only once.  Calling (push ITEM PLACE) is  similar  to
    calling  (setf  PLACE  (cons ITEM PLACE)) but only evaluates subforms of
    PLACE once instead of twice.  Depending on the PLACE form and the imple-
    mentation, push may also be more efficient.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq z '((3 4))) => ((3 4))
    (push '(1 2) z) => ((1 2) (3 4))
    (push '(foo) (car z)) => ((foo) 1 2)
    z => (((foo) 1 2) (3 4))
