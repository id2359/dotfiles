    FUNCTION
    log  -  calculate the logarithm of a number to a given base

    USAGE
    log number [base]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the logarithm of NUMBER, in the base BASE.  The base defaults to
    E, the base of the natural logarithms.  NUMBER may be any number.

    The branch cut for the natural logarithms is continuous with the  second
    quadrant,  and  lies on the negative real axis.  The domain excludes the
    origin.  The range is the portion of the  complex  plane  that  contains
    imaginary  parts from -J (exclusive) to J (inclusive).  The range of the
    two-argument version of log is the entire complex plane.

    When the arguments are rational and the result could (mathematically) be
    rational (as in the last example), whether the result is a rational or a
    float is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    (log (exp 2)) => 2.0
    (log 8.0 4) => 1.5
    ;;  Whether the following result is a float
    ;;  or an integer depends on the implementation:
    (log 16 2) => 4.0
