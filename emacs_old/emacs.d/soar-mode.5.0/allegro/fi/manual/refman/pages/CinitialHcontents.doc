    KEYWORD ARGUMENT
    :initial-contents  -  keyword argument for make-array and adjust-array
      specifying the contents

    USAGE
    :initial-contents contents

    DESCRIPTION
    This keyword option may be used with either make-array or  adjust-array.
    This keyword option provides a way of initializing the array with values
    that are not all the same.  For a zero-dimensional  array,  CONTENTS  is
    the  single element.  Otherwise, the argument is in the form of a nested
    structure of sequences.  The length of the  sequence  is  equal  to  the
    first  dimension.   Each element of the sequence is nested structure for
    the remaining dimensions of the array.

    When this keyword argument is used with adjust-array, it  specifies  the
    entire contents of the returned array.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq A (make-array '(2 3) :adjustable t
                        :initial-contents '((a b c) (1 2 3))))
      => #2a((a b c) (1 2 3))
    (setq B (adjust-array A '(3 4)
                          :initial-contents
                          '((d e f g) (h i j k) (l m n o))))
      => #2a((d e f g) (h i j k) (l m n o))
