    FUNCTION
    user-homedir-pathname  -  get pathname of user's home directory

    USAGE
    user-homedir-pathname [host]

    DESCRIPTION
    The definition of the user's home directory is implementation-dependent.
    Whatever definition is used by an implementation, this function returns,
    as a pathname, the path to that directory on the host machine identified
    by HOST.  If it cannot discover the necessary information, this function
    returns a pathname with nil name, type and version components if HOST is
    not  specified,  and  returns nil if HOST is specified.  The default for
    HOST and its interpretation are implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    In a hypothetical case, user DM on a Unix-like system might see the fol-
    lowing results:

    (directory-namestring (user-homedir-pathname)) => "/usr/tech/dm"
