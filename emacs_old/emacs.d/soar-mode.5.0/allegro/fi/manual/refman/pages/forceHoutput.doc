    FUNCTION
    force-output  -  initiates sending all buffered output to its destina-
      tion

    Usage
    force-output [STREAM]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    Initiates completion of all outstanding (buffered) output operations  to
    STREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil and initiates writing of any buffered output data to STREAM.
    This  function  differs  from finish-output in that it does not wait for
    completion or acknowledgement before  returning  nil.   This  function's
    behavior  and  effect  may  differ among implementations, and among dif-
    ferent types of streams in a single implementation.

    The argument STREAM may be a stream, nil, or  t.   If  it  is  nil,  the
    stream used is *standard-output*, which is also the default.  If it is t
    the stream used is *terminal-io*.

    EXAMPLES
    (force-output) => nil
