    CONSTANT
    boole-eqv  -  specify bitwise logical `equivalence' operation

    DESCRIPTION
    Used as the first argument to  boole  to  specify  the  bitwise  boolean
    `equivalence' operation.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (Since bitwise logical operations interpret integers as
    ;;  half-infinite, the result is negative, which in two's-
    ;;  complement representation has an infinite string of 1's
    ;;  to the right, that is toward higher-order bits.  The
    ;;  number #b-111 would be represented in two's-complement
    ;;  as ...11111001.)
    (boole boole-eqv #b1100 #b1010) => #b-111
    (ldb (byte 4 0) #b-111) => #b1001
    (logbitp 100 #b-111) => t
