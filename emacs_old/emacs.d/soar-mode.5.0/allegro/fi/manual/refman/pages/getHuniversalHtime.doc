    FUNCTION
    get-universal-time  -  get current time in Universal Time format

    Usage
    get-universal-time

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the current time in the single-integer format  called  Universal
    Time.   The  units are seconds.  Universal Time is the number of seconds
    since midnight of January 1, 1900, Greenwich Mean Time.  This  value  is
    based  on  every day having 86400 seconds.  (Thus, the occasional second
    adjustments by astronomers recognized by international time  authorities
    are  ignored.) Because Universal Time in COMMON LISP is represented as a
    non-negative integer, times before midnight of  January  1,  1900  (GMT)
    cannot  be  represented. Note that in many implementations, the returned
    value is a bignum.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The number you get will be larger, of course.
    ;;  The returned value represents 4:51:21 pm, June 16, 1987,
    ;;  in California (Pacific Daylight Time).
    (get-universal-time) => 2759874681
