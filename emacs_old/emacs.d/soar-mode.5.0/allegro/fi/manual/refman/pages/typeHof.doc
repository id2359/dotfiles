    FUNCTION
    type-of  -  get the type of an object

    USAGE
    type-of object

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a type specifier describing the type of  OBJECT.   The  returned
    type  is  implementation-dependent,  and merely gives some type to which
    OBJECT belongs.  This function is probably best used for debugging  pur-
    poses only.  For greater portability, try to use typep and typecase.

    EXAMPLES
    (type-of 4) => fixnum
    (type-of (coerce 3 '(complex float))) => complex
    (type-of "hello") => (simple-array string-char (5))
