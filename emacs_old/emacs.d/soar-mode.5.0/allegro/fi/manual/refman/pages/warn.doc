    FUNCTION
    warn  -  issue a warning

    USAGE
    warn format-string {arg}*

    SIDE EFFECTS
    If *break-on-warnings* is true, the debugger is invoked.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  This function signals a warning  by  printing  a  message,
    and,  if  the  value of the global variable *break-on-warnings* is true,
    invokes the debugger.  The message is printed by applying format to nil,
    FORMAT-STRING,  and  all ARG arguments, further processing the resulting
    string in an implementation-dependent way, and then writing  it  to  the
    stream  that  is  the value of *error-output*.  The FORMAT-STRING should
    not contain newlines at the beginning or end  nor  words  that  indicate
    that the message is a warning since these will be supplied automatically
    by any implementation.  Messages conventionally end  in  a  period.   No
    indentation should follow newlines within long warning messages.

    EXAMPLES
    (flet ((test (num)
             (when (evenp num)
               (warn "Please use an odd number.~%~
                  ~D is an even number. Please use an odd number."
                     num))
             (* num 2)))
      (test 4)) => 8
       PRINTS Warning: Please use an odd number.
             4 is an even number. Please use an odd number.
