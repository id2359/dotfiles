    FUNCTION
    char-bit  -  test whether a given bit is set in a character

    USAGE
    char-bit char bit

    DESCRIPTION
    The function char-bit returns true if the character bit named by BIT  is
    set in the character object CHAR, and false otherwise.

    The behavior of this function is implementation-dependent.   Implementa-
    tions  need  not  support  any character bits attributes but may support
    more than four, and may choose different names for supported bits.   The
    customary  names  for  character  bits  of  weights  1,  2, 4, and 8 are
    :control, :meta, :super, and :hyper, respectively.

    If CHAR is given by a place form acceptable to setf, then  char-bit  can
    be  used with setf to change the character at the location.  Setting the
    value to nil has the effect of clearing the bit and setting to any other
    value  has  the  effect of setting the bit.  Such a setf operation first
    performs a set-char-bit on the character at place  given  by  char  then
    replaces the character at char with the result.

    It is an error to call char-bit with the name of an unsupported  charac-
    ter bit.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The examples assume all four standard
    ;;  bits are supported with their usual names.
    (char-bit #\Control-A :control) => t
    (char-bit #\Meta-x :meta) => t
    (char-bit #\Meta-x :hyper) => nil
    (char-bit #\Super-y :super) => t

    (setq my-char #\Control-A) => #\CONTROL-A
    (setf (char-bit my-char :control) nil) => nil
    (char-bit my-char :control) => nil
