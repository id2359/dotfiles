    FUNCTION
    commonp  -  test whether an object is a COMMON LISP data type

    USAGE
    commonp object

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if OBJECT is of a standard COMMON LISP data type, and false
    otherwise.  A standard COMMON LISP data type is one required by the COM-
    MON LISP specification.  Types defined using deftype may satisfy commonp
    if the type-specifier expands to a standard COMMON LISP data type.  Note
    that objects of some general types,  e.g. number or array, may or not be
    commonp,  since  an  implementation  may have extended these types.  The
    following identity holds:

    (commonp x) = (typep x 'common)

    EXAMPLES
    (commonp 'a) => t
    (commonp '1.2.3) => t
    (commonp "xyz") => t
