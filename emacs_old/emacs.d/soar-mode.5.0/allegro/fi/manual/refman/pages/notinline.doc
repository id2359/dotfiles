    DECLARATION SPECIFIER
    notinline  -   advise compiler not to compile functions in-line

    USAGE
    notinline {function}*

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The COMMON LISP system is advised  that  each  FUNCTION  should  not  be
    open-coded.

    DESCRIPTION
    Like all declaration specifiers, notinline appears as the car of a  list
    followed  by the names of the functions to which it applies. Declaration
    specifiers may only appear in a declare or proclaim  form.   (It  is  an
    error to evaluate a declaration.) It is used with declare or proclaim to
    order the system not to compile the specified functions in-line.  We say
    `order'  since this declaration, unlike most others, may not be ignored.
    notinline observes the rules of lexical scoping, implying  that  a  form
    such as flet or labels may have notinline declarations which shadow glo-
    bal ones.

    EXAMPLES
    (proclaim '(notinline floor))
    (defun not-open-floor (num)
      (declare (notinline floor))
      (floor num))
