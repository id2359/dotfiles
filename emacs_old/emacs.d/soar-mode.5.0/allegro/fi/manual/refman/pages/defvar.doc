    MACRO
    defvar  -  declare a special variable

    USAGE
    defvar name [initform [doc-string]]

    DESCRIPTION
    Proclaims the variable NAME to be special, and returns NAME.  This macro
    is  usually used to declare and initialize globally-defined variables at
    the top level.  An optional initial value  is  given  by  the  value  of
    INITFORM,  which  is  evaluated and stored in NAME only if NAME does not
    already have a value.  If specified, a documentation  string  DOC-STRING
    of type variable is attached to NAME.

    EXAMPLES
    (defvar *max-files*) => *max-files*
    (defvar *workspace-path*
      (make-pathname :directory "foo")
      "Scratch directory.") => *workspace-path*
    (defvar foo 3) => foo
    foo => 3
    (defvar foo 4) => foo
    foo => 3
