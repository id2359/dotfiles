    CONSTANT
    char-hyper-bit  -  weight of the hyper bit of characters

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to the integer weight assigned to the hyper bit  of  the  bits
    attribute  of character objects.  An implementation need not support the
    hyper bit.  If it does, the value of this constant is  8.   If  it  does
    not, the value is 0.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following result is implementation-dependent:
    char-hyper-bit => 8
