    FUNCTION
    maphash  -  map a function over every entry of a hash table

    USAGE
    maphash fun ht

    DESCRIPTION
    This function maps a function over all the entries in a hash table.  The
    function  FUN is applied to two arguments, the key and the corresponding
    value, for each entry.  The order in which the entries are processed  is
    undefined.   After  all the entries have been processed, maphash returns
    nil.  The argument HT must be a hash table.

    This function is called for the side effects of FUN, but  care  must  be
    exercised  in  modifying  the  hash  table with this function since such
    modifications may cause unpredictable results.  However  two  operations
    are  guaranteed  to  work correctly and consistently: removing the entry
    being processed by applying remhash to the key argument passed  to  FUN,
    and  replacing  the  value  associated with the current entry by doing a
    setf of gethash on the key argument.

    EXAMPLES
    (hash-table-p (setq ht (make-hash-table))) => t
    (let (klist)
      (setf (gethash 'quick ht) 'brown)
      (setf (gethash 'fox ht) 'jumped)
      (setf (gethash 'over ht) 'fence)
      (maphash #'(lambda (k v) (setq klist (cons k klist))) ht)
      (sort klist #'string<))
      => (fox over quick)
