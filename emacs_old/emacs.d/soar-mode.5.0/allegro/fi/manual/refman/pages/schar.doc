    FUNCTION
    schar  -  extract a character from a simple string

    USAGE
    schar string i

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the ITH character of STRING as a character object.  STRING  must
    be  a  simple string or a symbol.  A simple string is any vector of ele-
    ment type string-char that has no fill pointer, is not displaced, and is
    not  adjustable.   If  STRING is a symbol, its print name is used as the
    string to operate on.  I must be a non-negative integer  less  than  the
    length  of  the string (indexing is zero-origin).  You may use setf with
    this function to replace (destructively) a character within STRING, pro-
    vided  STRING  is  NOT  a  symbol.  The function schar applied to simple
    strings behaves identically to aref or char, but it may be  faster  than
    either in many implementations.

    EXAMPLES
    (schar "Hello" 0) => #\H
    (schar "Hello" 4) => #\o
    (let ((welcome "Hella"))
      (setf (schar welcome 4) #\o)
      welcome) => "Hello"
