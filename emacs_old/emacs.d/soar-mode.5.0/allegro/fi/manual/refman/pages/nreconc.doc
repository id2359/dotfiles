    FUNCTION
    nreconc  -  nconc two lists, reversing the first list in place (destruc-
      tive)

    USAGE
    nreconc list1 list2

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The argument LIST1 is destroyed.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a list formed by destructively reversing LIST1 and concatenating
    the  result  and  LIST2.   Both  arguments must be lists.  The following
    identity holds:

    (nreconc x y) = (nconc (nreverse x) y)

    nreconc may or may not modify its first argument.  (The second  argument
    is  not modified.)  Therefore, it is advisable to use setq to change the
    value of a variable given as the first argument to nreconc.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x '(a b c)) => (a b c)
    (setq y '(d e)) => (d e)
    (nreconc x y) => (c b a d e)
    x => (a d e)
