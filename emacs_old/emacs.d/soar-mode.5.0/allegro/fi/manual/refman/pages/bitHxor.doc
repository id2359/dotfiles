    FUNCTION
    bit-xor  -  perform a bitwise logical `exclusive or' on two bit arrays

    USAGE
    bit-xor bit-array1 bit-array2 [result-array]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    If RESULT-ARRAY is provided as  an  argument,  then  it  will  hold  the
    results  of  the  logical  operation and thus be modified.  RESULT-ARRAY
    must be a bit array of the same rank and dimensions  as  the  other  two
    arguments.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `exclusive or' of BIT-ARRAY1 and BIT-ARRAY2,
    which  must  both  be  bit  arrays of the same rank and dimensions.  The
    result is produced by performing the operation on corresponding elements
    of  the  two  arrays.  If the optional argument RESULT-ARRAY is not pro-
    vided, a new bit array is created and returned.  The logical  `exclusive
    or' of two bits is 1 if and only if the bits are different.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  #* is the reader macro for bit vectors.
    (setq bit-arr (make-array 4 :element-type 'bit))
    (bit-xor #*1100 #*1010 bit-arr) => #*0110
    bit-arr => #*0110
