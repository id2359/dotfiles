    FUNCTION
    notany  -  test whether no group of corresponding sequence elements sa-
      tisfies a test

    Usage
    notany PRED {SEQUENCE}+

    DESCRIPTION
    This function applies the predicate PRED  to  successive  elements  from
    each  sequence.   PRED must take as many arguments as there are argument
    sequences.  The first application of PRED is to all the  first  elements
    of SEQUENCES.  The second is to all the second elements, and so on.  The
    first time PRED returns true, notany returns nil without further  compu-
    tation.   If  the  end  of any argument sequence is reached without PRED
    returning true, notany returns a non-nil value.

    EXAMPLES
    (notany #'eq '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6)) => t
    (notany #'oddp '(2 4 612 34 52)) => t
    (notany #'atom '((a) (b) 1 2)) => nil
    (notany #'= '(1 2) '(3 4) '(5 6 1 2 3 4)) => t
