                                                                  fresh-line


    FUNCTION
    fresh-line  -  output a newline to a stream if not at beginning of line

    Usage
    fresh-line [STREAM]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A newline (the character #\newline) is output to STREAM if the next out-
    put  operation  would not otherwise be at the beginning of the  line, or
    if this information cannot be determined.  (This may be  implementation-
    dependent and dependent on the nature of the stream.)

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns t if a newline was output and nil otherwise.

    The argument STREAM may be a stream, nil, or  t.   If  it  is  nil,  the
    stream  used  is *standard-output*, which is also the default value.  If
    STREAM is t, the stream used is *terminal-io*.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  FRESH-LINE only prints a newline if it must.  TERPRI always does.

    <cl> (progn (format t  "fred")
                (terpri)
                (fresh-line t)
                (format t  "fred"))
    fred
    fred
    nil
    <cl> (progn (format t  "fred")
                (fresh-line t)
                (terpri)
                (format t  "fred"))
    fred

    fred
    nil
    ;;  The value NIL is the returned value from the
    ;;  the FORMAT in the PROGN.
