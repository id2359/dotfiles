    CONSTANT
    array-rank-limit  -  exclusive upper bound on array dimensionality

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to an integer that is one larger than  the  maximum  allowable
    rank  for an array.  The rank of an array is defined to be the number of
    dimensions of the array.  This value  is  implementation-dependent,  but
    must be at least 8.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The returned value is implementation-dependent.
    array-rank-limit => 65536
