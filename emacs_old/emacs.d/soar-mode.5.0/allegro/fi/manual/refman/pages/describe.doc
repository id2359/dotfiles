    FUNCTION
    describe  -  print information about an object

    Usage
    describe OBJECT

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns   no   values   and   prints   information   about   OBJECT   to
    *standard-output*.    The   nature   and   format   of   the  output  is
    implementation-dependent.  The description of a symbol may  include  its
    value,  definition  and  a list of its properties.  The description of a
    floating-point number may show its internal representation in a way that
    is useful for finding rounding errors.  Sometimes there are things to be
    described that occur inside of other items, and in  this  case  describe
    will print the information with appropriate nesting.

    EXAMPLES
    Evaluating

    (describe 'cons)

    causes something like this to be printed:

    cons is a symbol
      It is unbound
      It is external in the lisp package
      Its function binding is #<Function cons @ #x262501>
       The function takes arguments (excl::x excl::y)
      Its property list has these indicator/value pairs:
    compiler::.args.            (2 . 2)
    m68k::.s-bifs.              m68k::s-cons
    compiler::a-priori          12
