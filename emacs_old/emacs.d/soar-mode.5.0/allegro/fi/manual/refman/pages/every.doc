    FUNCTION
    every  -  test whether every set of corresponding elements of sequences
      satisfies a predicate

    Usage
    every PRED {SEQUENCES}+

    DESCRIPTION
    This function applies the predicate PRED  to  successive  elements  from
    each  sequence.   PRED must take as many arguments as there are argument
    sequences.  The first application of PRED is to all the  first  elements
    of SEQUENCES.  The second is to all the second elements, and so on.  The
    first time PRED returns false, every returns nil without further  compu-
    tation.   If  the  end  of any argument sequence is reached without PRED
    returning false, every returns a non-nil value.

    EXAMPLES
    (every #'eq '(1 2 3) '(1 2 6)) => nil
    (every #'oddp '(17 33 1 3 5)) => t
    (every #'atom '(a b 1 2 (3))) => nil
