    CONSTANT
    boole-andc1  -  specify bitwise logical `and' operation, complementing
      operand one

    DESCRIPTION
    Used as the first argument to boole to specify the bitwise boolean `and'
    operation  that  complements  its  first operand (the second argument to
    boole).

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (The printer drops leading zeros when printing integers.
    ;;  The printed number #b10 is equivalent to #b0010.)
    (boole boole-andc1 #b1100 #b1010) => #b10
