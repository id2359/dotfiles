    VARIABLE
    *break-on-warnings*  -  flag to determine whether to go into a break
      loop when warnings occur

    SIDE EFFECTS
    If this flag is non-nil, then calls to the function warn will cause COM-
    MON LISP to go into the debugger.

    DESCRIPTION
    When this variable has a non-nil value, warnings cause  a  break.   When
    this  variable is nil, warnings print messages but do not interrupt exe-
    cution of a COMMON LISP program.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The details of the following script are
    ;;  implementation-dependent.
    <cl> (LET ((*BREAK-ON-WARNINGS* T))
           (WARN "PLEASE DON'T DO THIS."))
    Break: Please don't do this.
    Restart actions (select using :continue):
     0: return from break.
    [1c] <cl> :CONTINUE
    Warning: Please don't do this.

    <cl>
