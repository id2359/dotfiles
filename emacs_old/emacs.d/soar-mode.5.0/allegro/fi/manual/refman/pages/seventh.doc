    FUNCTION
    seventh  -  get the seventh element of a list

    USAGE
    seventh list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the seventh element of LIST, where the car of LIST is considered
    to be the first element.  LIST must be a list.

    Unlike the nth function, which uses zero-origin indexing, this  function
    uses  one-origin  indexing.   If the list has fewer than seven elements,
    nil is returned.  setf may be used with seventh to replace  the  seventh
    element of a list.

    EXAMPLES
    (seventh '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => g
    (seventh '(a)) => nil
    (setq lis '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => (a b c d e f g h i j)
    (setf (seventh lis) 7) => 7
    lis => (a b c d e f 7 h i j)
