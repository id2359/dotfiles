    FUNCTION
    char-not-equal  -  test whether given characters are all different, ig-
      noring case and bits

    USAGE
    char-not-equal {char}+

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if each CHAR is not identical to any other CHAR  specified,
    ignoring  case  and  bits attributes and taking into account font attri-
    butes in an implementation-dependent manner.  Returns  false  otherwise.
    Two  characters  are  considered  identical  by  this function when they
    differ only in case.  If two characters differ in their font attributes,
    they  may  or may not be identical depending upon the implementation and
    possibly upon the font  attributes.   Each  CHAR  must  be  a  character
    object.   The function char/= is like char-not-equal except that it also
    checks case, and bits and font attributes.

    EXAMPLES
    (char-not-equal #\b #\b) => nil
    (char-not-equal #\b #\c) => t
    (char-not-equal #\b #\B) => nil
    (char/= #\b #\B) => t
    (char-not-equal #\b) => t
    (char-not-equal #\a #\A #\Control-A) => nil
