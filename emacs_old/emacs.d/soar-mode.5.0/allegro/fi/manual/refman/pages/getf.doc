    FUNCTION
    getf  -  retrieve a specified property value from a property list

    USAGE
    getf place indicator [default]

    DESCRIPTION
    Searches the property list stored  in  PLACE  for  an  indicator  eq  to
    INDICATOR.   If  it is found, then its associated value is returned.  If
    it is not found and DEFAULT is specified, then DEFAULT is returned; oth-
    erwise  nil  is  returned.   Note  that  there  is no way to distinguish
    between an absent property and one whose value is DEFAULT.  (But, as the
    last example shows, if DEFAULT is an object which CANNOT be the value of
    a property, then DEFAULT  being  returned  means  the  property  is  not
    present  on  the  list.  In the example, DEFAULT is a symbol returned by
    gensym created when getf is called.)

    setf may be used with getf, but then PLACE must be a form acceptable  to
    setf.   Using  setf adds a new indicator-value pair to the property list
    kept in PLACE, or updates an existing pair.   DEFAULT  is  ignored  when
    getf is used with setf, but it is used when other macros associated with
    setf, such as push and incf are used with getf.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf score
      '(jim 10 john 33 david 11 cathy 6 kevin 22))
       => (jim 10 john 33 david 11 cathy 6 kevin 22)
    (getf score 'jim) => 10
    (setf (getf score 'bill) 0) => 0
    (getf score 'bill) => 0
    (incf (getf score 'bill)) => 1
    (getf score 'bill) => 1
    (getf score 'lois) => nil
    (getf score 'lois 'not-in-game) => not-in-game
    (incf (getf score 'lois 0)) => 1
    (getf score 'lois) => 1

    (defun prop? (place indicator &aux (none (gensym)))
      "Always returns NIL if there is no property with
      the given INDICATOR in PLACE."
      (not (eq (getf place indicator none) none)))
