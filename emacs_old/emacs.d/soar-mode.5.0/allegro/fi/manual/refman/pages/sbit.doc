    FUNCTION
    sbit  -  get a specified bit in a bit array

    USAGE
    sbit sbit-array {subscript}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bit that is stored at the location in  SBIT-ARRAY  indicated
    by  the  subscripts.   Each  SUBSCRIPT  must  be  a  valid subscript for
    SBIT-ARRAY, and the total number of subscripts must equal  the  rank  of
    the  array.   SBIT-ARRAY must be a simple array of bits.  A simple array
    is not displaced to another array, does not have a fill pointer, and  is
    not  dynamically  adjustable in size.  This function can be used in con-
    junction with setf to destructively replace an element of a bit array.

    When operating on a simple bit array, this function is identical to aref
    or bit.  This function may, however, be faster than aref and bit in many
    implementations.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq bit-arr (make-array '(2 3) :element-type 'bit
                                     :initial-contents '(#*011 #*101)))
    (sbit bit-arr 1 2) => 1
    (bit bit-arr 1 2) => 1
    (setf (sbit bit-arr 1 2) 0) => 0
    (sbit bit-arr 1 2) => 0
