    CONSTANT
    lambda-list-keywords  -  list of all lambda-list keywords

    DESCRIPTION
    This constant evaluates to a list of  all  valid  lambda-list  keywords,
    including  those  used  only by defmacro and those added in a particular
    implementation.  Thus, the exact list is  implementation-dependent,  but
    must have as a subset the list shown in the example.

    EXAMPLES
    (subsetp '(&optional &rest &key &aux &body &whole
               &allow-other-keys &environment)
             lambda-list-keywords) => t
