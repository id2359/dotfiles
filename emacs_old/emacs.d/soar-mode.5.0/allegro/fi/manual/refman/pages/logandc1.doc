    FUNCTION
    logandc1  -  bitwise logical `and', complementing the first argument

    USAGE
    logandc1 n1 n2

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `and' of N2 and the complement of  N1,  both
    of  which must be integers.  Arguments and results are interpreted as if
    represented in two's-complement notation.  The following identity holds:

    (logandc1 x y) = (logand (lognot x) y)

    EXAMPLES
    (logandc1 1 -5) => -6

    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (The printer drops leading zeros when printing integers.
    ;;  The printed number #b10 is equivalent to #b0010.)
    (logandc1 #b1100 #b1010) => #b10
