    FUNCTION
    char=  -  test whether given characters are all the same

    USAGE
    char= {char}+

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if each CHAR is equal to every other  CHAR  specified,  and
    false  otherwise.   Each  CHAR must be a character object.  To be equal,
    characters must have the same code, bits  attributes,  and  font  attri-
    butes.   Characters  that are char= are not necessarily eq.  Two charac-
    ters that are eq are, however, char=.  Both eql and equal compare  char-
    acters  with  char=; equalp uses char-equal.  The function char-equal is
    like char= except that it ignores case, and bits and font attributes.

    EXAMPLES
    (char= #\b #\b) => t
    (char= #\b #\c) => nil
    (char= #\b #\B) => nil
    (char-equal #\b #\B) => t
    (char= #\b) => t
    (char= #\a #\a #\a) => t
    (char= #\a #\Control-A) => nil
