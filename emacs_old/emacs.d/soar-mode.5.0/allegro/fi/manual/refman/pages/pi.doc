    CONSTANT
    pi  -  approximation to pi in long floating-point format

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the best approximation  of  J  in  long  floating-point  format.
    Approximations  of  J in other precisions may be produced using float or
    coerce.  (Note that an implementation is free to collapse  two  or  more
    floating-point  formats  into  one.   In  the  example,  long-float  and
    double-float are collapsed, so the value is printed as a double-float.)

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Implementation-dependency: PI is a double-float.
    pi => 3.141592653589793d0
    (float pi 4.0s0) => 3.1415927s0
