    FUNCTION
    endp  -  test for the end of a list

    USAGE
    endp object

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if OBJECT is nil, and false if it is  a  cons.   It  is  an
    error  for  OBJECT to be any other type of argument (and implementations
    are encouraged to signal an error).  Thus, endp returns true if the  end
    of  a  true  list is reached, returns false if the end of a list has not
    been reached, and (in many  implementations)  signals  an  error  on  an
    object  which  cannot  be  a cdr of a true list.  Using endp is the best
    test for the end of a list.

    EXAMPLES
    (endp '(a b)) => nil
    (endp '()) => t
    (setq x '(1 2 3 4 5)) => (1 2 3 4 5)
    (do ((y x (cdr y))
         (sum 0 (+ sum (car y))))
        ((endp y) sum)) => 15

    ;;  Tried to apply endp to a non-cons:
    (do ((dlis '(1 2 . 3) (cdr dlis))
         (sum 0 (+ sum (car dlis))))
        ((endp dlis) sum)) => ERROR

    ;;  Tried to apply endp to a non-cons:
    (endp 'x)  => ERROR
