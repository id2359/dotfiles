    FUNCTION
    list-all-packages  -  get a list of all packages currently defined

    USAGE
    list-all-packages

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a list of all currently existing packages.  The elements of  the
    returned  list  are  package  objects,  not  package  names  (which  are
    strings).

    The exact list returned depends on the implementation and (obviously) on
    what  you  have done.  The example shows what packages will exist in any
    implementation.

    EXAMPLES
    (subsetp
      (list (find-package :lisp)
            (find-package :user)
            (find-package :keyword)
            (find-package :system))
      (list-all-packages)) => t
