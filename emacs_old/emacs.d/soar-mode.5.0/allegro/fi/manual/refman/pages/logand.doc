    FUNCTION
    logand  -  bitwise logical `and'

    USAGE
    logand {n}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `and' of its arguments, all of which must be
    integers.   If  no  arguments  are specified, -1 is returned.  -1 is the
    identity for this function.  All arguments and results  are  interpreted
    as if represented in two's-complement notation.

    EXAMPLES
    (logand) => -1
    (logand 1) => 1
    (logand 1 3) => 1

    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    (logand #b1100 #b1010) => #b1000
