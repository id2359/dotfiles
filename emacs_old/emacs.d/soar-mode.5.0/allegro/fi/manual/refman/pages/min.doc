    FUNCTION
    min  -  get the number among the arguments closest to negative infinity

    USAGE
    min {n}+

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the the minimum, i.e., the number that is  closest  to  negative
    infinity among all the arguments, which must be real numbers.  Implemen-
    tations are relatively free with regard to  the  type  of  the  returned
    value.   It  is always permitted to return the smallest value as is.  If
    two arguments have the same value but are of differing  types,  say  one
    rational   and  one  double-float,  either  may  be  returned.   If  any
    floating-point numbers appear in the arguments,  an  implementation  may
    coerce  the  result  to  be  a floating-point number even if the largest
    value is rational.  But if any coercion is done, the result  will  be  a
    floating-point  number  in  the  widest format appearing in the argument
    list.

    EXAMPLES
    (min 5 2) => 2
    (min 5 2.0) => 2.0
    (min 5.0 2 ) => 2
    (min 2.0d0 5.0s0) => 2.0d0
    (min 2.0s0 5.0d0) => 2.0s0
