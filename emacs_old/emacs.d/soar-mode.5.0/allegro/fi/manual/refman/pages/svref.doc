    FUNCTION
    svref  -  get an element of a simple general vector

    USAGE
    svref simple-vector index

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the element of SIMPLE-VECTOR at index INDEX.   The  indexing  is
    zero-based,  so  the  first element is at index 0.  The vector must be a
    simple general vector, that is a unidimensional array of element type  t
    that  has  no  fill  pointer,   is not displaced, and is not adjustable.
    This function may be used in  conjunction  with  setf  to  destructively
    replace an element of a vector.

    EXAMPLES
    (let ((w  (vector 'a 'b 'c 'd 'e)))
      (svref w 4)) => e
    (let ((w (vector 'a 'b 'c 'd 'e) ))
      (setf (svref w 4)'z)
      w) => #(a b c d z)
