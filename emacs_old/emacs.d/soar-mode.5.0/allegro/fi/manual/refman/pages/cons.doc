    Type SPECIFIER
    cons  -  the data type cons

    Usage
    cons

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies the data type consisting of all conses.  A cons is a structure
    with  two  components:   a car and a cdr.  A list is the symbol nil or a
    cons the cdr of which is a list.

    The printed representation of a cons is the same as for a general  list,
    a   list   of  LISP  objects  delimited  by  spaces  and  surrounded  by
    parentheses.  There may be a dot (#\.) surrounded by  whitespace  before
    the last element of the list.

    EXAMPLES
    (typep '(a . b) 'cons) => t
    (typep '(a b . c) 'cons) => t
    (typep '(a b c) 'cons) => t
