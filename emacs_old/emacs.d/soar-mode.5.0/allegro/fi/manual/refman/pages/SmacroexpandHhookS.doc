    VARIABLE
    *macroexpand-hook*  -  name of macro-expansion interface hook function

    USAGE
    *macroexpand-hook*

    DESCRIPTION
    This special symbol evaluates to the hook function for macro  expansion.
    Its  value  is normally the symbol funcall, but some implementations may
    use another function.  The value must be acceptable as the first  (func-
    tion) argument to apply or funcall.

    The value of this  symbol  is  applied  to  three  arguments,  a  macro-
    expansion function, a macro-call form and an environment.  The result of
    this application must return the expansion of the macro-call form.  This
    is  the  mechanism  used  by  macroexpand-1  to expand a macro call, and
    macroexpand-1 in turn is used by the evaluator eval  when  a  macro-call
    form is evaluated.

    One possible use of a hook function is to cache macro expansions to gain
    speed in the interpreter.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The standard value is funcall:
    *macroexpand-hook* => funcall
