    FUNCTION
    cdr  -  get the CDR cell of a list

    USAGE
    cdr list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the cdr of LIST, which must be a cons or nil (that is,  it  must
    be  of  type  list).  The cdr of nil is defined to be nil.  The cdr of a
    dotted pair is the second element of the  printed  representation.   The
    cdr of a list is a sublist containing all but the first element.

    EXAMPLES
    (cdr '(a . b)) => b
    (cdr (cons 'a 'b)) => b
    (cdr '(w x y z)) => (x y z)
    (cdr '(((u) v))) => nil
    (cdr '(1 2 3)) => (2 3)
    (let* ((a '(1 2 3))
           (b (cdr a)))
      (eq b (cdr a))) => t
    ;;  Cannot take the cdr of a non-cons.
    (cdr "(a b c)") => ERROR
