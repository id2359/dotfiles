    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~%  -  print newline character

    USAGE
    ~count%

    DESCRIPTION
    Prints COUNT (default 1) newlines.  Putting a newline in the format con-
    trol  string  instead of ``~%'' accomplishes the same thing.  Printing a
    newline means printing a #\newline character.

    EXAMPLES
    (let () (format t "Hello world.~%") (format t "Bye.")) => nil
    PRINTS
    Hello world.
    Bye.
