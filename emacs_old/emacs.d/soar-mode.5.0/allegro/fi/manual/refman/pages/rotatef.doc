    MACRO
    rotatef  -  end-around shift of generalized variables (destructive)

    USAGE
    rotatef {place}*

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The values in the locations specified by the generalized-variable refer-
    ences PLACE are destructively modified.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  This macro is used for its side  effects.   The  value  of
    each  generalized  variable  PLACE is first determined and saved.  Then,
    the value of each PLACE, beginning with the leftmost PLACE and  proceed-
    ing  to  the  right, is replaced by the saved value of the PLACE immedi-
    ately to its right.  The value of the last  PLACE  is  replaced  by  the
    saved  value  of  the first (leftmost) PLACE.  Note that any subforms of
    each PLACE form are evaluated only once.  The PLACES can be  thought  of
    as  forming  a shift register, with the first value being rotated around
    to the end.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x 1 y 2 z 3)
    (rotatef x y z) => nil
    x => 2
    y => 3
    z => 1
