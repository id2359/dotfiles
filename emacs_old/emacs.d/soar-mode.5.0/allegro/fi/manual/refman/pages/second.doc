    FUNCTION
    second  -  get the second element of a list

    USAGE
    second list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the second element of LIST, where the car of LIST is  considered
    to be the first element.  LIST must be a list.

    Unlike the nth function, which uses zero-origin indexing, this  function
    uses  one-origin indexing.  If the list has fewer than two elements, nil
    is returned.  setf may be used with second to replace the second element
    of a list.

    EXAMPLES
    (second '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => b
    (second '(a)) => nil
    (setq lis '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => (a b c d e f g h i j)
    (setf (second lis) 2) => 2
    lis => (a 2 c d e f g h i j)
