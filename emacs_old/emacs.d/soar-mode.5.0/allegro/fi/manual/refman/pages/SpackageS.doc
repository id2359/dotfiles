    VARIABLE
    *package*  -  variable whose value is the current package

    USAGE
    *package*

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to the current package.  Its value must be a package, and  the
    initial value is the user package.

    The function load binds *package* to its current value, thus  in  effect
    storing  the  current  value  and  restoring it when the load completes.
    This allows the value of *package* to be changed by forms  in  the  file
    being loaded without changing the current package when load returns.

    EXAMPLES
    (package-name *package*) => "USER"
