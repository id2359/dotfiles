    FUNCTION
    char  -  extract a character from a string

    USAGE
    char string i

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the I-th character of STRING as a character object.  STRING must
    be a string and I must be a non-negative integer less than the length of
    STRING (indexing is zero-origin).  You may use setf with  this  function
    to  replace  (destructively)  a  character within STRING.  The following
    identity holds:

    (char s i) = (aref (the string s) i)

    EXAMPLES
    (char "Hello" 0) => #\H
    (char "Hello" 4) => #\o
    (setq welcome "Hella") => "Hella"
    (progn (setf (char welcome 4) #\o) welcome) => "Hello"
    welcome => "Hello"
