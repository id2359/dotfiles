    FUNCTION
    integer-decode-float  -  get internal representation of a float, scaling
      the significand to an integer

    USAGE
    integer-decode-float float

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns three values, computed in a fashion analogous  to  decode-float,
    except  that  all  the  returned  values  are integers.  FLOAT must be a
    floating-point number.

    If FLOAT is 0.0, the first returned value will  be  0.   Otherwise,  the
    first  value  will  be  an  integer between two successive powers of the
    radix of floating-point representation so that all the accuracy in FLOAT
    is  preserved.   Specifically,  let  R  be  the  radix  of  the internal
    floating-point representation, as returned  by  float-radix.   Then  the
    first value returned will be an integer in the range from

    (expt R (- (float-precision float) 1))

    (inclusive) , to

    (expt R (float-precision float))

    (exclusive) .

    The second returned value will be an integer equal to  the  exponent  of
    the  radix that makes the first returned value times the radix raised to
    that exponent equal to the absolute value of FLOAT (after  it  has  been
    coerced to the correct format).

    The third returned value is -1  or  1  as  FLOAT  is  negative  or  non-
    negative.

    EXAMPLES
    (integer-decode-float 8.0) => 8388608 -20 1
    (integer-decode-float -8.0) => 8388608 -20 -1
    (integer-decode-float 0.125d0) => 4503599627370496 -55 1
    (integer-decode-float 0.0) => 0 0 1
