    FUNCTION
    make-pathname  -  make a pathname out of given components

    USAGE
    make-pathname [:host h] [:device d] [:directory r] [:name n] [:type t]
      [:version v] [:defaults path]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a new pathname  with  components  explicitly  specified  by  the
    optional keyword arguments :host, :device, :directory, :name, :type, and
    :version, and with unspecified components filled in from a default path-
    name  using  the  same  merging rules as merge-pathnames.  If you do not
    explicitly specify a default pathname, a pathname having the  same  host
    component  as  *default-pathname-defaults*  and  nil  for all other com-
    ponents  is  used  as  the  default  pathname.   When  a   pathname   is
    constructed,  its components may be `canonicalized' if appropriate in an
    implementation-dependent way.

    EXAMPLES
    (let* ((x (make-pathname :name "foo" :host nil))
           (y (make-pathname :name "bar" :host "liszt"))
           (mxy (merge-pathnames x y)))
      (list
       (pathname-name x) (pathname-host x)
       (pathname-name mxy) (pathname-host mxy)))
      => ("foo" nil "foo" "liszt")
