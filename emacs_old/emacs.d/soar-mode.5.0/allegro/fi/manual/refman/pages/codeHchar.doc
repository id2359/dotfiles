    FUNCTION
    code-char  -  make a character given code, bits and font attributes

    USAGE
    code-char code [bits [font]]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a character object with the given CODE, BITS,  and  FONT  attri-
    butes  provided such a character is possible, and returns nil otherwise.
    The optional arguments BITS and FONT both default to zero.  All  of  the
    arguments  must  be non-negative integers.  The association between code
    values and characters and whether bits and font attributes are supported
    are implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The results in these examples are implementation-dependent;
    ;;  they are reasonable for an ASCII-based implementation.
    ;;  Construct a character out of control bit and `A' character:
    (code-char 65 char-control-bit) => #\control-A

    ;;  Note that ASCII control-A (ASCII code 1) is definitely not
    ;;  the same as a Lisp character with a `control' bit attribute.
    (char= #\control-A (code-char 1)) => nil
    (char-code (code-char 65 1 2)) => 65
    (char-bits (code-char 65 1 2)) => 1
    (char-font (code-char 65 1 2)) => 2
