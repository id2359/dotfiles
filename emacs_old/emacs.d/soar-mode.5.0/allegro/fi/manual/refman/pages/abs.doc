    FUNCTION
    abs  -  get the absolute value of a number

    USAGE
    abs number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the absolute value of NUMBER, which must be a number.  If NUMBER
    is  real,  the result has the same type as NUMBER.  Note that for a com-
    plex argument, the absolute value is also called the magnitude, and  is,
    by definition,

    (abs z) = (sqrt (+ (expt (realpart z) 2) (expt (imagpart z) 2)))

    EXAMPLES
    (abs 4) => 4
    (abs -4) => 4
    (abs #c(3.0 -4.0)) => 5.0
