    FUNCTION
    copy-tree  -  copy a tree of conses

    USAGE
    copy-tree object

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a new tree of conses obtained by  recursively  copying  all  the
    conses in OBJECT, provided it is a cons.  If OBJECT is not a cons, it is
    simply returned.  Substructure sharing and circularities in  OBJECT  are
    not preserved.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x '((a b) (c (d e)))) => ((a b) (c (d e)))
    (setq y (copy-tree x)) => ((a b) (c (d e)))
    (cadadr x) => (d e)
    (eq (cadadr x) (cadadr y)) => nil
    (equal (cadadr x) (cadadr y)) => t
