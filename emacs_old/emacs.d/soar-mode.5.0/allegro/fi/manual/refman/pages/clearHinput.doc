    FUNCTION
    clear-input  -  clear buffered input from a stream

    Usage
    clear-input [STREAM]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    This function flushes buffered input associated with STREAM.  It may  be
    used for clearing type-ahead from keyboard input.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  This function is used for its side effects.  The  argument
    STREAM,  if  supplied,  must  be a stream, nil, or t.  If it is nil, the
    stream *standard-input* is used.  That is also  the  default  value  for
    this argument.  If STREAM is T, then *terminal-io* is used.

    If flushing input buffers is not meaningful for  the  specified  STREAM,
    clear-input does nothing.
