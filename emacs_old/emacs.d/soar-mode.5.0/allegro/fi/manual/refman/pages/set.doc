    FUNCTION
    set  -  unquoted assignment statement

    USAGE
    set sym val

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The value of the special symbol named by SYM is set to the value of VAL.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns VAL, but set is principally used  for  its  side  effects.   set
    differs  from  setq in that it evaluates its first argument.  set cannot
    change the value of a lexically-bound variable.  This  function  changes
    the  current  dynamic binding of a special variable, or the global value
    if there is no binding.

    EXAMPLES
    (set 'foo '(a b c)) => (a b c)
    foo => (a b c)
    (setq a '(x y z)) => (x y z)
    (set (car a) 10) => 10
    x => 10
