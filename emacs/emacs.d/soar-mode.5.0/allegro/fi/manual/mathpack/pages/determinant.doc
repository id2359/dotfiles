    FUNCTION
    determinant  -  get the determinant of a square matrix

    USAGE
    determinant matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns as multiple values the determinant of MATRIX and its  reciprocal
    condition  number,  which  is  defined  below.   MATRIX must be a square
    matrix whose element-type (as returned by array-element-type) is one  of
    single-float,  double-float, (complex single-float), or (complex double-
    float).  (Generally, the type should be specified  when  the  matrix  is
    created,  either  with  make-matrix or make-array.  Matrices returned by
    the      functions       single-float-matrix,       double-float-matrix,
    complex-single-float-matrix,  or  complex-double-float-matrix  also have
    element types appropriate for this function.) It is an error  if  MATRIX
    is  not  square  or  does not have its element type listed above.  (Note
    that even if all elements are in fact of  a  single,  appropriate  type,
    this  function  will  not work unless the element type is also correct).
    This function does not change its argument  in  any  way.   The  related
    function ndeterminant destroys MATRIX while calculating its determinant.

    About half the work in calculating the determinant of a matrix  is  also
    necessary  in  calculating its inverse.  If you also need the inverse of
    MATRIX, we suggest that you call the  function  determinant-and-inverse,
    rather than this function and inverse individually.

    The RECIPROCAL CONDITION NUMBER is described in detail in section 1.4 of
    the  LINPACK  USERS'  GUIDE.  Briefly, there is a way to modify the ele-
    ments of the matrix by amounts less than the reciprocal condition number
    so  that  the  changed matrix is singular.  Therefore, if this number is
    smaller than the accuracy of the elements of your matrix,  some  results
    are  numerically  meaningless  since  the  matrix  cannot be numerically
    distinguished from a singular matrix.  If this value is  less  than  the
    Common  Lisp  constant  single-float-epsilon, if the matrix elements are
    single floats, or  double-float-epsilon,  if  the  elements  are  double
    floats,  attempts to calculate either the inverse or the eigen values or
    vectors will fail.  (The determinant of a  matrix  singular  to  machine
    precision  is  assumed  to  be zero.  Zero is returned is the reciprocal
    condition number is too small regardless of the values of  the  elements
    of the matrix.)

    EXAMPLES
    (print-matrix
      (setq r-mat (make-matrix '((2.0 3.0) (5.0 8.0))
                                'single-float))) PRINTS
      2.0 3.0
      5.0 8.0
    (determinant r-mat) => 1.0000005 0.0081448
    ;;  The true value is 1.0.  5.0s-7 is within machine
    ;;  accuracy.

    ;;  In the following, we do not specify the element type
    ;;  and we get an error when we apply determinant:
    (print-matrix
      (setq m-mat (make-matrix '((-3.0 4.0) (-5.0 7.0))))) PRINTS
      -3.0 4.0
      -5.0 7.0
    (determinant m-mat) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Can't take determinant of anything
    ;;  except a floating-point matrix
    ;;
    ;;  DETERMINANT will work if we first apply SINGLE-FLOAT-MATRIX:
    (determinant (single-float-matrix m-mat)) =>
      -1.0
      0.008558559
