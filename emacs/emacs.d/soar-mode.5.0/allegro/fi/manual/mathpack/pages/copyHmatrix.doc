    FUNCTION
    copy-matrix  -  get a copy of a matrix

    USAGE
    copy-matrix matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a copy of MATRIX, which must be a matrix.  The elements  of  the
    copy  have  the  same values as the elements of MATRIX but no storage is
    common to both matrices.

    This function works on matrices only.  It cannot be used to copy a  vec-
    tor.  (The Common Lisp function copy-seq may be used to copy vectors.)

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat1 (make-matrix '((1.0 1.3) (2.2 4.6))))
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
       1.0 1.3
       2.2 4.6
    (setq mat2 (copy-matrix mat1))
    (print-matrix mat2) PRINTS
       1.0 1.3
       2.2 4.6

    ;;  No storage is shared by MAT1 and MAT2, so if we
    ;;  modify MAT1, MAT2 is unchanged.
    (setf (aref mat1 0 0) 222.2)
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
       222.2 1.3
       2.2   4.6
    (print-matrix mat2) PRINTS
       1.0 1.3
       2.2 4.6
