    FUNCTION
    ndeterminant-and-inverse  -  destructively replace a matrix with its in-
      verse and calculate determinant

    USAGE
    ndeterminant-and-inverse matrix [:error-if-singular eis]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns three values as multiple values.  The first is  MATRIX  destruc-
    tively replaced by its inverse, the second is the determinant of MATRIX,
    and the third is is the reciprocal condition number of MATRIX (described
    below).   MATRIX must be a square matrix whose element-type (as returned
    by array-element-type) is one of  single-float,  double-float,  (complex
    single-float),  or  (complex double-float).  (Generally, the type should
    be specified when the matrix is  created,  either  with  make-matrix  or
    make-array.   Matrices  returned  by  the functions single-float-matrix,
    double-float-matrix,  complex-single-float-matrix,  or   complex-double-
    float-matrix  also have element types appropriate for this function.) It
    is an error if MATRIX is not square or does not have  its  element  type
    listed  above.  (Note that even if all elements are in fact of a single,
    appropriate type, this function will not work unless the element type is
    also  correct).   This function modifies its argument, replacing it with
    its inverse.  The  related  function  determinant-and-inverse  does  not
    modify its argument.

    If MATRIX is singular  to  machine  precision,  ndeterminant-and-inverse
    cannot calculate the inverse.  To discover whether MATRIX is singular to
    machine precision, ndeterminant-and-inverse  calculates  the  reciprocal
    condition  number  for  the matrix and then tests if that number is less
    than single-float-epsilon or double-float-epsilon (depending on the pre-
    cision  of  the  matrix  elements).   If  the  value  is larger than the
    appropriate epsilon, the inverse and the determinant are calculated  and
    MATRIX  (now  inverted),  the  determinant, and the condition number are
    returned as multiple values.  If the value is less than the  appropriate
    epsilon,  the  behavior  depends  on the value of the :error-if-singular
    keyword argument.  If  the  value  of  this  argument  is  non-nil  (the
    default),  an  error  is generated if the matrix cannot be inverted.  If
    the value of this argument is nil, then ndeterminant-and-inverse returns
    nil, the determinant value, and the condition number as multiple values.
    Note that nil is not a matrix and thus will generate an error if  it  is
    used  as  the  matrix  argument  to any function.  Note further that the
    argument MATRIX is already modified before the impossibility of  invert-
    ing it is discovered.

    The RECIPROCAL CONDITION NUMBER is described in detail in section 1.4 of
    the  LINPACK  USERS'  GUIDE.  Briefly, there is a way to modify the ele-
    ments of the matrix by amounts less than the reciprocal condition number
    so  that  the  changed matrix is singular.  Therefore, if this number is
    smaller than the accuracy of the elements of your matrix, the result  is
    numerically   meaningless   since   the  matrix  cannot  be  numerically
    distinguished from a singular matrix.  If this value is  less  than  the
    Common  Lisp  constant  single-float-epsilon, if the matrix elements are
    single floats, or  double-float-epsilon,  if  the  elements  are  double
    floats,  attempts to calculate either the inverse or the eigen values or
    vectors will fail.  The determinant of a  matrix  that  is  singular  to
    machine precision is assumed to be zero.  That value is returned regard-
    less of the values of the elements of the matrix.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The determinant of the example matrix is 1.0, so
    ;;  the inverse will have integral elements (to machine
    ;;  accuracy).
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((7.0d0 5.0d0) (4.0d0 3.0d0)) 'double-float))
      => #2a((7.0d0 5.0d0) (4.0d0 3.0d0))
    (ndeterminant-and-inverse mat) =>
       1.0d0
       #2a((3.0d0 -5.0d0) (-4.0d0 7.0d0))
       0.00855855855855858d0
    ;;  Note: the returned matrix values were rounded in the text.
    ;;  The difference between the given value and the returned
    ;;  value is never greater than 1.0d-13.
    ;;  Now MAT contains its inverse:
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      2.999999999999992d0   -4.999999999999986d0
      -3.9999999999999893d0 6.999999999999981d0
    ;;  These values are not rounded.

    ;;  Note if we do not specify the element type, we
    ;;  get an error even though all elements are in fact
    ;;  single floats.  But applying DETERMINANT-AND-INVERSE
    ;;  to the result of DOUBLE-FLOAT-MATRIX works.
    (setq mat1 (make-matrix '((3.0d0 -5.0d0) (-4.0d0 7.0d0))))
    (ndeterminant-and-inverse mat1) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Attempt to invert something other
    ;;         than a floating-point matrix
    ;;  The solution is:
    (ndeterminant-and-inverse (double-float-matrix mat1)) =>
       1.0d0
       #2a((7.0d0 5.0d0) (4.0d0 3.0d0))
       0.008949599623174782d0
    ;;  Note that MAT and MAT1 are inverses (to machine accuracy).
    ;;  The returned matrix elements are again rounded.

    ;;  Let us apply this function to a singular matrix:
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0) (1.0 2.0)) 'single-float))
      => #2a((1.0 2.0) (1.0 2.0))
    (ndeterminant-and-inverse mat) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Attempt to invert singular matrix
    ;;  MAT is now modified:
    mat => #2a((2.0 -0.5) (2.0 0.0))

    ;;
    ;;  Specifying the :ERROR-IF-SINGULAR keyword argument as
    ;;  NIL suppresses the error message.  NIL is returned as
    ;;  the inverse matrix value (we remake MAT since it was
    ;;  destroyed by the last operation):
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0) (1.0 2.0)) 'single-float))
    (ndeterminant-and-inverse mat :error-if-singular nil)
      => nil 0.0 0.0
    ;;  Note that the determinant is zero.
