    FUNCTION
    conjugate-transpose  -  get the conjugate transpose of a matrix

    USAGE
    conjugate-transpose matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a new matrix that is the conjugate transpose of MATRIX.   Recall
    that  the  complex  conjugate  of the complex number a+bi is a-bi.  This
    function uses the Common Lisp function conjugate on the elements of  the
    matrix,  so,  as  the examples show, if the elements of MATRIX are real,
    this function is equivalent to transpose.   (Indeed,  only  the  complex
    elements  have  their  values  changed at all, although all off-diagonal
    elements will be repositioned.) The argument MATRIX is unchanged by this
    function.   The  related  function nconjugate-transpose is a destructive
    version of this function that works on square matrices only.

    It is an error if MATRIX is not a matrix.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat1 (make-matrix '((#c(1.0 2.0) #c(1.3 -4.6))
                              (#c(-2.0 1.7) #c(-6.4 -5.5)))))
    (setq mat2 (make-matrix '((1.0 1.3) (2.2 4.6))))
    (setq mat3 (make-matrix '((1 #c(5.0 2.0) 1/2 3.0))))

    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
       #c(1.0 2.0)   #c(1.3 -4.6)
       #c(-2.0 1.7)  #c(-6.4 -5.5)

    (print-matrix (conjugate-transpose mat1)) PRINTS
       #c(1.0 -2.0)  #c(-2.0 -1.7)
       #c(1.3 4.6)   #c(-6.4 5.5)

    (print-matrix mat2) PRINTS
       1.0 1.3
       2.2 4.6
    (print-matrix (conjugate-transpose mat2)) PRINTS
       1.0 2.2
       1.3 4.6

    (print-matrix mat3) PRINTS
       1           #c(5.0 2.0) 1/2         3.0
    (print-matrix (conjugate-transpose mat3)) PRINTS
       1
       #c(5.0 -2.0)
       1/2
       3.0
