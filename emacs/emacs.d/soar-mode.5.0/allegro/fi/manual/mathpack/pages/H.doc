    FUNCTION
    -  -  get the difference of a number, matrix, or vector and the sum of
      more numbers, matrices, or vectors

    Usage
    - ARGS+

    DESCRIPTION
    This standard Common Lisp function has been modified  to  accept  matrix
    and  vector  as  well as scalar arguments.  All the arguments must be of
    the same type.  When the arguments  are  scalars  (i.e.  numbers),  this
    function  works just as when Allegro Matrix is not loaded: returning the
    difference of the first argument and the sum of the remaining  arguments
    (or  the negative of the first argument if there is only one).  When the
    arguments are all matrices or all vectors, they must all be of the  same
    dimension  (length for vectors, number of rows and number of columns for
    matrices).  Elements of vectors or matrices are subtracted  elementwise,
    that  is  the  element  in a particular position in the result matrix or
    vector is the result of applying - to the elements in that  position  in
    the argument matrices or vectors.

    There is no limit to the number of arguments to  this  function  (except
    the  value  of call-arguments-limit, of course).  There must be at least
    one argument.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We define some matrices and vectors:
    (setq mat1 (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0) (-3.0 4.0))))
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
      1.0  2.0
      -3.0 4.0
    (setq mat2 (make-matrix '((-5.0 7.0) (0.0 1.0))))
    (print-matrix mat2) PRINTS
      -5.0 7.0
      0.0  1.0
    (setq vec1 (make-array 2 :initial-contents '(-10.0 +10.0)))
      => #(-10.0 10.0)
    (setq vec2 (make-array 2 :initial-contents '(10.0 +10.0)))
      => #(10.0 10.0)
    (print-matrix (- mat1)) PRINTS
      -1.0 -2.0
      3.0  -4.0
    (print-matrix (- mat1 mat2)) PRINTS
      6.0  -5.0
      -3.0 3.0
    (- vec1 vec2) => #(-20.0 0.0)
    ;;  You cannot have both numbers and matrices among the arguments:
    (- 10 mat1) => ERROR
    ;;  the error message is:
    ;;  Error: All arguments to - must be numbers, OR vectors of
    ;;  same length, OR matrices of same dimension

    ;;  If you want to subtract the same value from all matrix elements,
    ;;  create a matrix with MATRIX-WITH-INITIAL-ELEMENT and make
    ;;  it the second argument to -..
    ;;  You also cannot mix matrices and vectors, or vectors and numbers
    ;;  in the argument to -.
