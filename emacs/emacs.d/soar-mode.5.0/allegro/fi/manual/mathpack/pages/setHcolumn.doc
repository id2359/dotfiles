    FUNCTION
    set-column  -  change a specified column of a matrix

    USAGE
    set-column matrix column vector

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns MATRIX after destructively  changing  the  column  specified  by
    COLUMN  to  have  the  elements  of  VECTOR.  COLUMN must be an integer.
    Recall that indexing is zero-origin, so  COLUMN  must  be  between  zero
    (inclusive) and the number of columns of MATRIX (exclusive).

    VECTOR must be a vector with as many elements as MATRIX has  rows.   The
    elements  of  VECTOR  must  be  of  an  appropriate type to be stored in
    MATRIX.   Thus,  if  the  element  type  of  MATRIX  (as   returned   by
    array-element-type) is single-float, VECTOR cannot contain elements that
    cannot be coerced to single-floats.

    It is an error if MATRIX is not a matrix, VECTOR is not a vector, COLUMN
    is  not an integer, COLUMN specifies a non-existent column of MATRIX, or
    VECTOR has length different from the number of rows of MATRIX.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0) (3.0 4.0)) 'single-float))
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      1.0 2.0
      3.0 4.0
    (setq vec (make-array 2 :initial-contents '(-10.0 -10.0)))
      => #(-10.0 -10.0)
    (print-matrix (set-column mat 0 vec)) PRINTS
      -10.0 2.0
      -10.0 4.0
    (print-matrix (set-column mat 1 vec)) PRINTS
      -10.0 -10.0
      -10.0 -10.0
    ;;  MAT is now totally modified:
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      -10.0 -10.0
      -10.0 -10.0

    ;;  It is an error to specify a non-existent column of MAT:
    (set-column mat 2 vec) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Bad column specifier (or not that many columns)
    ;;  in set-column

    ;;  Since MAT has element type SINGLE-FLOAT, it is an error
    ;;  to try to use SET-COLUMN with a vector containing
    ;;  a complex element.
    (setq vec1 (make-array 2 :initial-contents '(10 #c(1.0 1.0))))
      => #(10 5.0d0)
    (set-column mat 1 vec1) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: illegal argument to float: #c(1.0 1.0)
