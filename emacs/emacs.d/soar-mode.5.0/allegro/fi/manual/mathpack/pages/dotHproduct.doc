    FUNCTION
    dot-product  -  get the dot (inner) product of two vectors

    USAGE
    dot-product vec1 vec2

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the dot (or inner) product of two vectors.  The dot  product  is
    defined as the sum of the products of the elements of VEC1 with the com-
    plex conjugate of the corresponding elements of VEC2.  Thus, if VEC1  is
    (2.0   1.0)   and   VEC2  is  (1.0+1.0i  0-1.0i),  the  dot  product  is
    2.0*(1.0-1.0i) + 1.0*(0+1.0i) which is 2.0-1.0i.

    It is an error if either VEC1 or VEC2 are not vectors or if they do  not
    have the same length.

    Note that the dot product of a vector with  itself  has  imaginary  part
    zero  (up to machine accuracy).  Its value is equal to the square of the
    (geometric) length of the vector.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq vec1 (make-array 2 :initial-contents '(2.0 1.0)))
      => #(2.0 1.0)
    (setq vec2 (make-array 2 :initial-contents '(#c(1.0 1.0) #c(0.0 -1.0))))
      => #(#c(1.0 1.0) #c(0.0 -1.0))
    (dot-product vec1 vec2) => #c(2.0 -1.0)
    (dot-product vec2 vec2) => #c(3.0 0.0)
