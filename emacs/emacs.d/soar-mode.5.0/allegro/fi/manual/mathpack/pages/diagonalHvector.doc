    FUNCTION
    diagonal-vector  -  get a vector whose elements are the diagonal ele-
      ments of a square matrix

    USAGE
    diagonal-vector matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a vector whose elements are the diagonal elements of the  square
    matrix  MATRIX.   It  is an error if MATRIX is not a square matrix.  The
    length of the returned vector will be the same as  either  dimension  of
    MATRIX.  The element type of the returned vector will be the same as the
    element type of MATRIX.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat1 (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0) (3.0 4.0)) 'single-float))
      => #2a((1.0 2.0) (3.0 4.0))
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
      1.0 2.0
      3.0 4.0
    (diagonal-vector mat1) => #(1.0 4.0)
    (array-element-type (diagonal-vector mat1)) => single-float

    ;;  Note that when the element type of the argument matrix
    ;;  is not specified, the returned vector has element type T.
    (setq mat2 (make-matrix '((5.0 7.0) (-6.0 -8.0))))
      => #2a((5.0 7.0) (-6.0 -8.0))
    (diagonal-vector mat2) => #(5.0 -8.0)
    (array-element-type (diagonal-vector mat2)) => t
