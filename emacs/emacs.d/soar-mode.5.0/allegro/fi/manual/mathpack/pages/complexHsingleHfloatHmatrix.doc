    FUNCTION
    complex-single-float-matrix  -  Coerce all matrix elements to be complex
      single-floats

    USAGE
    complex-single-float-matrix matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  a  new  matrix  whose  array  element  type  (as  returned   by
    array-element-type) is (complex single-float) and whose elements are the
    elements of MATRIX coerced to be complex single-floats.

    Some functions,  such  as  inverse  and  determinant,  only  operate  on
    matrices  whose array element type is one of single-float, double-float,
    (complex single-float), or (complex double-float).  But matrices may  be
    created  with  any  numerical  type  (or  even t) as their element type.
    Matrices with inappropriate type cannot be passed to the functions  that
    require  the  type  be from the list above.  Applying this function to a
    matrix produces a matrix suitable for passing to those functions.   Note
    that  MATRIX itself is unaffected by this function.  The returned matrix
    does not share any storage with MATRIX.

    It is an error if any element  of  MATRIX  cannot  be  coerced  to  type
    (complex  single-float).   (Among  numeric values, only some bignums and
    some double floats cannot be so coerced.)

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1 1/2) (1.0 3.0d0))))
      => #2a((1 1/2) (1.0 3.0d0))
    (array-element-type mat) => t
    (setq mat1 (complex-single-float-matrix mat))
      => #2a((#c(1.0 0.0) #c(0.5 0.0)) (#c(1.0 0.0) #c(3.0 0.0)))
    (array-element-type mat1) => (complex single-float)
