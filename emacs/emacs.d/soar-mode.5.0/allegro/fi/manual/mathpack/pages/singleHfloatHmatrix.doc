    FUNCTION
    single-float-matrix  -  Coerce all matrix elements to be single-floats

    USAGE
    single-float-matrix matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  a  new  matrix  whose  array  element  type  (as  returned   by
    array-element-type)  is single-float and whose elements are the elements
    of MATRIX coerced to be single-floats.

    Some functions,  such  as  inverse  and  determinant,  only  operate  on
    matrices  whose array element type is one of single-float, double-float,
    (complex single-float), or (complex double-float).  But matrices may  be
    created  with  any  numerical  type  (or  even t) as their element type.
    Matrices with inappropriate type cannot be passed to the functions  that
    require  the  type  be from the list above.  Applying this function to a
    matrix produces a matrix suitable for passing to those functions.   Note
    that  MATRIX itself is unaffected by this function.  The returned matrix
    does not share any storage with MATRIX.

    It is an error if any element  of  MATRIX  cannot  be  coerced  to  type
    single-float.   In  particular, no entry in MATRIX may be complex.  Some
    double-floats and bignums also cannot be coerced to be single floats.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1 1/2) (1.0 3.0d0))))
      => #2a((1 1/2) (1.0 3.0d0))
    (array-element-type mat) => t
    (setq mat1 (single-float-matrix mat))
      => #2a((1.0 0.5) (1.0 3.0))
    (array-element-type mat1) => single-float

    ;;  We cannot apply this function to a matrix
    ;;  any of whose elements are complex.
    ;;
    (single-float-matrix (make-matrix '((#c(1.0 1.0))))) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: illegal argument to float: #c(1.0 1.0)
    ;;
    ;;  (Note the error is in FLOAT, not SINGLE-FLOAT-MATRIX.)
