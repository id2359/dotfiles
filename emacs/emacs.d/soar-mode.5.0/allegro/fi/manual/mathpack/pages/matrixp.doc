    FUNCTION
    matrixp  -  test whether an object is a matrix

    Usage
    matrixp OBJECT

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns t if OBJECT is a  matrix  and  nil  otherwise.   A  `matrix'  in
    Allegro  Matrix  is  a two dimensional array with numerical elements.  A
    `vector' is a one dimensional array with numerical elements.   A  vector
    is  NOT  a matrix.  Note that this function does NOT check that the con-
    tents of the matrix are numeric objects.  (Doing so would  significantly
    slow the execution of this function.)

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  You can define matrices in several ways.  Here are two.
    (setq mat1 (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0 3.0) (4.0 5.0 6.0))
                            'single-float))
    (setq mat2 (make-array '(1 2) :initial-contents '((1.0 2.0))))
    (matrixp mat1) => t
    (matrixp mat2) => t
    ;;  A vector is not a matrix:
    (matrixp (make-array 3 :initial-contents '(1.0 2.0 3.0))) => nil
    ;;  Nor is a 2x2x2 array:
    (matrixp (make-array '(2 2 2) :initial-contents
                         '(((1 1) (1 1)) ((1 1) (1 1))))) => nil
    ;;  But a 2 dimensional array with non numeric elements will
    ;;  satisfy MATRIXP even though it is not a true matrix.
    (matrixp (make-array '(1 2) :initial-contents '((not numbers)))) => t
