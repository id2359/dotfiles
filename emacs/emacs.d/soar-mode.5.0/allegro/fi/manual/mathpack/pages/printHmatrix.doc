    FUNCTION
    print-matrix  -  print a matrix in pretty format

    USAGE
    print-matrix matrix [stream]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil but this function is used for its side effects.   It  prints
    the  value  of MATRIX, one row at a time, to the stream specified by the
    optional argument STREAM.  A blank line is printed before and after  the
    matrix.

    If STREAM is not specified or nil, the matrix will  be  printed  to  the
    stream  that  is the value of *standard-output*.  If STREAM is specified
    as t, the matrix  is  printed  to  the  stream  that  is  the  value  of
    *terminal-io*.   Otherwise, the matrix is printed to the stream which is
    the value of STREAM.

    Each entry in the matrix is converted to a string.  For  each  row,  the
    strings are printed out on a single line.  (That is, there is not return
    or linefeed in the code to print-matrix.  However, unless a  matrix  has
    very  few  columns, the rows will probably spill over a single line.  No
    effort is made to control or prettify the printing of individual rows.)

    EXAMPLES
    (print-matrix (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0) (3.0 4.0)))) PRINTS
      1.0 2.0
      3.0 4.0
      => nil
    ;;  Note: blank lines before and after the printed matrix
    ;;  have been removed in this example.
