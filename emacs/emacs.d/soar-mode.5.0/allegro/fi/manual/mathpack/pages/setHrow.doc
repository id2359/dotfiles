    FUNCTION
    set-row  -  change a specified row of a matrix

    USAGE
    set-row matrix row vector

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns MATRIX after destructively changing the row specified by ROW  to
    have  the  elements  of  VECTOR.   ROW  must be an integer.  Recall that
    indexing is zero-origin, so ROW must be between zero (inclusive) and the
    number of rows of MATRIX (exclusive).

    VECTOR must be a vector with as many elements as MATRIX has  rows.   The
    elements  of  VECTOR  must  be  of  an  appropriate type to be stored in
    MATRIX.   Thus,  if  the  element  type  of  MATRIX  (as   returned   by
    array-element-type) is single-float, VECTOR cannot contain elements that
    cannot be coerced to be single-floats.

    It is an error if MATRIX is not a matrix, VECTOR is not a vector, ROW is
    not  an  integer,  ROW specifies a non-existent row of MATRIX, or VECTOR
    has length different from the number of columns of MATRIX.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0) (3.0 4.0)) 'single-float))
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      1.0 2.0
      3.0 4.0
    (setq vec (make-array 2 :initial-contents '(-10.0 -10.0)))
      => #(-10.0 -10.0)
    (print-matrix (set-row mat 0 vec)) PRINTS
      -10.0 -10.0
      3.0   4.0
    (print-matrix (set-row mat 1 vec)) PRINTS
      -10.0 -10.0
      -10.0 -10.0
    ;;  MAT is now totally modified:
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      -10.0 -10.0
      -10.0 -10.0

    ;;  It is an error to specify a non-existent row of MAT:
    (set-row mat 2 vec) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Bad row specifier (or not that many rows)
    ;;  in set-row

    ;;  Since MAT has element type SINGLE-FLOAT, it is an error
    ;;  to try to use SET-COLUMN with a vector containing
    ;;  a DOUBLE-FLOAT:
    (setq vec1 (make-array 2 :initial-contents '(10 #c(1.0 1.0))))
      => #(10 5.0d0)
    (set-row mat 1 vec1) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: illegal argument to float: #c(1.0 1.0)
