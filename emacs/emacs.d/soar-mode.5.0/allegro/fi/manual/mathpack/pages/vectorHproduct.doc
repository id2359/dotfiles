    FUNCTION
    vector-product  -  get the vector product of two vectors

    USAGE
    vector-product vector1 vector2

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a matrix that is the vector product of the two argument vectors,
    VECTOR1 and VECTOR2.  The vector product, also called the outer product,
    of two vectors is an NXM matrix, where N is the length of VECTOR1 and  M
    is  the  length of VECTOR2.  The I,JTH element of the matrix is the pro-
    duct of the ITH element of VECTOR1 and the JTH element of VECTOR2.   The
    following identity holds:

    (vector-product vec1 vec2)
      = (* (column-matrix vec1) (row-matrix vec2))

    The element type (as  returned  by  array-element-type)  of  the  result
    matrix  depends  on the element types of the arguments vectors.  If both
    are specific, the result matrix has the specific  element  type  of  its
    elements.  If either is t, the result matrix has element type t.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq vec1 (make-array 2 :element-type 'single-float
                             :initial-contents '(1.0 2.0)))
      => #(1.0 2.0)
    (setq vec2 (make-array 3 :element-type 'double-float
                             :initial-contents '(-1.0d0 -2.0d0 -3.0d0)))
      => #(-1.0d0 -2.0d0 -3.0d0)
    (print-matrix (vector-product vec1 vec2)) PRINTS
      -1.0d0 -2.0d0 -3.0d0
      -2.0d0 -4.0d0 -6.0d0
    (array-element-type (vector-product vec1 vec2)) => double-float
    (print-matrix (vector-product vec2 vec1)) PRINTS
      -1.0d0 -2.0d0
      -2.0d0 -4.0d0
      -3.0d0 -6.0d0
