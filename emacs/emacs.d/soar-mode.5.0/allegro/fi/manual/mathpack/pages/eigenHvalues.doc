    FUNCTION
    eigen-values  -  get the eigenvalues of a square matrix

    USAGE
    eigen-values matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a vector (always complex, single or double  float  according  to
    the  type  of MATRIX) containing the eigenvalues of MATRIX.  MATRIX must
    be   a   square   matrix   whose   element   type   (as   returned    by
    array-element-type)  is  one  of  single-float,  double-float,  (complex
    single-float), or (complex double-float).  It is an error if the  matrix
    does not have one of those element types.

    The returned vector will have the same length as the  dimension  (recall
    that  MATRIX  is  square)  of MATRIX.  If for any reason the eigenvalues
    cannot be calculated, an error is signaled.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.0 -2.0 3.0) (-5.0 7.0 2.0) (3.0 -1.0 0.0))
                           'single-float))
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      1.0  -2.0 3.0
      -5.0 7.0  2.0
      3.0  -1.0 0.0
    (eigen-values mat)
      => #(#c(-2.8226268 0.0) #c(8.36666 0.0) #c(2.4559662 0.0))
