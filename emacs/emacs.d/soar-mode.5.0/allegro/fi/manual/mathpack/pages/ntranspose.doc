    FUNCTION
    ntranspose  -  destructively transpose a square matrix

    USAGE
    ntranspose matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns MATRIX after destructively transposing it.   MATRIX  must  be  a
    square  matrix.   The I,JTH of MATRIX after this function returns is the
    same as the J,ITH element before this function was  called.   It  is  an
    error  if MATRIX is not a square matrix.  The related function transpose
    works on general matrices.

    The element type (as returned by array-element-type) MATRIX  after  this
    function returns is the same as the element type before this function is
    called.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat1 (make-matrix '((#c(1.0 1.0) #c(2.0 2.0))
                              (#c(3.0 3.0) #c(4.0 4.0)))))
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
      #c(1.0 1.0) #c(2.0 2.0)
      #c(3.0 3.0) #c(4.0 4.0)
    (print-matrix (ntranspose mat1)) PRINTS
      #c(1.0 1.0) #c(3.0 3.0)
      #c(2.0 2.0) #c(4.0 4.0)
    ;;  MAT1 is now changed:
    (print-matrix mat1) PRINTS
      #c(1.0 1.0) #c(3.0 3.0)
      #c(2.0 2.0) #c(4.0 4.0)
    ;;  NTRANSPOSE will not work on a non-square matrix.
    ;;  (TRANSPOSE will work, however.)
    (ntranspose (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0)))) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Non-square matrix argument to ntranspose
    (print-matrix (transpose (make-matrix '((1.0 2.0))))) PRINTS
      1.0
      2.0
