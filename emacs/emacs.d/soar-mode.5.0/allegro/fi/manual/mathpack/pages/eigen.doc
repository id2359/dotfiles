    FUNCTION
    eigen  -  get the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix

    USAGE
    eigen matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns two values as multiple values, a vector (always complex,  single
    or  double  float according to the type of MATRIX) containing the eigen-
    values of MATRIX and a matrix containing  the  eigenvectors,  stored  as
    rows, of MATRIX.  The eigenvector stored in the ITH row is guaranteed to
    correspond to the ITH value in the vector of eigenvalues.

    MATRIX  must  be  a  square  matrix  whose  element  type  is   one   of
    single-float,  double-float, (complex single-float), or (complex double-
    float).  It is an error if the matrix does not have one of those element
    types.

    The returned vector will have the same length as the  dimension  (recall
    that  MATRIX  is square) of MATRIX.  The returned matrix of eigenvectors
    has the same dimension as MATRIX.  If for any reason the eigenvalues  or
    eigenvectors cannot be calculated, an error is signaled.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.0 -2.0 3.0) (-5.0 7.0 2.0) (3.0 -1.0 0.0))
                           'single-float))
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      1.0  -2.0 3.0
      -5.0 7.0  2.0
      3.0  -1.0 0.0
    ;;  Two values are returned form the following function,
    ;;  first the vector of eigenvalues, then the matrix of
    ;;  eigenvectors:
