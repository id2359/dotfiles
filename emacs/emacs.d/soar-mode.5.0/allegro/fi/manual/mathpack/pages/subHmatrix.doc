    FUNCTION
    sub-matrix  -  get a submatrix of a matrix

    USAGE
    sub-matrix matrix dimensions displacement

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a new matrix that is a submatrix of MATRIX.  DIMENSIONS must  be
    a  list  of  two  elements,  specifying the dimensions of the submatrix.
    DISPLACEMENT is a list of two elements specifying the  entry  in  MATRIX
    that  will  be  the  0,0TH  entry  in the submatrix (the upper left-hand
    entry).  The returned matrix does not share storage with MATRIX.

    Note that the submatrix elements are contiguous elements in MATRIX.  You
    cannot use this function to form a matrix containing, say, the first and
    last column of MATRIX when MATRIX has more than two columns.

    It is an error if MATRIX is not a matrix, if DIMENSIONS and DISPLACEMENT
    are  not  lists  of  exactly  two  elements,  if  the  first  element of
    DIMENSIONS plus the first element of DISPLACEMENT minus one  is  greater
    than  the  first  dimension  of  MATRIX,  or  if  the  second element of
    DIMENSIONS plus the second element of DISPLACEMENT minus one is  greater
    than  the  second dimension of MATRIX.  (These last two restrictions say
    that the submatrix cannot be too large to fit into  MATRIX  starting  at
    DISPLACEMENT.)

    The element type (as  returned  by  array-element-type)  of  the  result
    matrix is the same as the element type of the argument MATRIX.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1.1 1.2 1.3) (2.1 2.2 2.3)
                             (3.1 3.2 3.3)) 'single-float))
    (print-matrix mat) PRINTS
      1.1 1.2 1.3
      2.1 2.2 2.3
      3.1 3.2 3.3
    (print-matrix (sub-matrix mat '(2 2) '(1 1))) PRINTS
      2.2 2.3
      3.2 3.3
    (print-matrix (sub-matrix mat '(1 1) '(0 0))) PRINTS
      1.1
    (print-matrix (sub-matrix mat '(3 1) '(0 2))) PRINTS
      1.3
      2.3
      3.3
    (print-matrix (sub-matrix mat '(3 2) '(0 1))) PRINTS
      1.2 1.3
      2.2 2.3
      3.2 3.3

    ;;  Note that the element type of the returned submatrix
    ;;  is the same as that of the argument:
    (array-element-type (sub-matrix mat '(2 2) '(1 1)))
      => single-float

    ;;  It is an error if the specified submatrix exceeds
    ;;  the bounds of MATRIX:
    (sub-matrix mat '(2 1) '(2 2)) => ERROR
    ;;  The error message is:
    ;;  Error: Not that many elements in matrix: can't make sub-matrix

    ;;  The same error message is generated when the DISPLACEMENT
    ;;  argument is outside the argument matrix:
    (sub-matrix mat '(1 1) '(3 3)) => ERROR
