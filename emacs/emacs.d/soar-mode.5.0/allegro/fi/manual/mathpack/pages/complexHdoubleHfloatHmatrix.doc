    FUNCTION
    complex-double-float-matrix  -  Coerce all matrix elements to be complex
      double-floats

    USAGE
    complex-double-float-matrix matrix

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  a  new  matrix  whose  array  element  type  (as  returned   by
    array-element-type) is (complex double-float) and whose elements are the
    elements of MATRIX coerced to be complex double-floats.

    Some functions,  such  as  inverse  and  determinant,  only  operate  on
    matrices  whose array element type is one of single-float, double-float,
    (complex single-float), or (complex double-float).  But matrices may  be
    created  with  any  numerical  type  (or  even t) as their element type.
    Matrices with inappropriate element type cannot be passed to  the  func-
    tions that require the type be from the list above.  Applying this func-
    tion to a matrix produces a matrix suitable for passing to  those  func-
    tions.   Note  that  MATRIX  itself is unaffected by this function.  The
    returned matrix does not share any storage with MATRIX.

    It is an error if any element  of  MATRIX  cannot  be  coerced  to  type
    (complex  double-float).   (Only some bignums cannot be so coerced among
    numeric values.)

    EXAMPLES
    (setq mat (make-matrix '((1 1/2) (1.0 3.0d0))))
      => #2a((1 1/2) (1.0 3.0d0))
    (array-element-type mat) => t
    (setq mat1 (complex-double-float-matrix mat))
      => #2a((#c(1.0d0 0.0d0) #c(0.5d0 0.0d0))
              (#c(1.0d0 0.0d0) #c(3.0d0 0.0d0)))
    (array-element-type mat1) => (complex double-float)
