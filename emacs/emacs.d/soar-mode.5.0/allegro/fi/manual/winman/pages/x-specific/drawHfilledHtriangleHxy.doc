    FUNCTION
    draw-filled-triangle-xy  -  draw a filled triangle on a graphic stream

    Usage
    draw-filled-triangle-xy GR-STREAM X1 Y1 X2 Y2 X3 Y3 [:color COLOR]
      [:operation OPERATION]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A filled triangle, determined by the given coordinates, is drawn on  the
    graphic  stream  GR-STREAM,  which  must  be either a window-stream or a
    bitmap-stream.  The three  vertices  of  the  triangle  are  the  points
    (X1,Y1), (X2,Y2), (X3,Y3).  The triangle is filled with the color speci-
    fied by the value of the :color keyword argument, or the value  returned
    by window-stream-foreground-color.

    Not all edges of a filled triangle are drawn.  (Thus a  filled  triangle
    is  NOT  just  an  ordinary  triangle filled in.) If the interior of the
    triangle lies to the left of the edge, the edge will  not  be  drawn.  A
    horizontal  edge which lies above the interior of the triangle rectangle
    will not be drawn.  Vertices are only drawn when both adjacent edges are
    drawn.   Leaving  edges out in this way allows a window to be tiled with
    the triangle without double covering of edges.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  The arguments X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, and Y3 must all be  real
    numbers.  All coordinates are give respect to the extent coordinate sys-
    tem of GR-STREAM.  For a function which specifies the coordinates of the
    triangle in terms of positions, use draw-filled-triangle.

    The keyword argument :operation specifies  the  boolean  operation  that
    will  be used when the bits from the drawing operation are combined with
    the bits on the graphic stream.  This argument defaults to the value  of
    window-stream-operation  applied to GR-STREAM.  All the sixteen standard
    boolean operations of COMMON LISP are supported.  The  keyword  argument
    :color,  specifies  the  drawing  color,  and if not specified, uses the
    color returned by window-stream-foreground-color.

    Note that draw-filled-triangle-xy, and all the related  triangle-drawing
    functions,  are  not methods.  This makes them different from all of the
    other drawing functions, which are  currently  implemented  as  methods.
    The draw-triangle family CANNOT be customized for each graphics stream.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
            (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
            :width 200 :height 200
            :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))
