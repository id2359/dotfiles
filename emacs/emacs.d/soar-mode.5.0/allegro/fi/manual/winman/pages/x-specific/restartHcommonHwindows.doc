    FUNCTION
    restart-common-windows  -  restart COMMON WINDOWS after a dumplisp

    Usage
    restart-common-windows [:host HOST][:verbose VERBOSE][GC-CURSOR GC-
      CURSOR]

    DESCRIPTION
    This function returns what the last function in the list  bound  to  the
    global variable *restart-common-windows-actions* returns.  This function
    may be used to restart COMMON WINDOWS after a dumplisp  where  you  have
    saved  some  COMMON  WINDOWS  state.  First, you should invoke the saved
    Lisp image, and then you should call restart-common-windows, rather than
    initialize-common-windows.   COMMON WINDOWS will resume inthe same state
    as when if was dumped out.

    You can customize the behavior of restart-common-windows by changing the
    contents of the list bound to *restart-common-windows-actions*.

    restart-common-windows calls the functions in that list  in  order,  all
    with  the  same  arguments  passed  to  restart-common-windows  itself .
    (Actually, the list contains symbols denoting functions rather than  the
    function objects themseleves.) Initially, this list consists of the sin-
    gle item default-restart-common-windows.  This function does the  actual
    work  of  restarting  COMMON WINDOWS so you should insure that it is NOT
    removed from the list .  The following paragraphs describe the  behavior
    of default-restart-common-windows.

    The  keyword  argument  :host,  must   be   a   string   of   the   form
    HOST-NAME[SERVER-NUMBER[DISPLAY-NUMBER]],  and  is  used  to specify the
    name of the machine that will be the X server.  If  this  DISPLAY-NUMBER
    is not specified, it defaults to 0.  SERVER-NUMBER also defaults to 0 if
    not specified.  If the  :host  argument  itself  is  not  specified,  it
    defaults to the value of the DISPLAY environment variable on the machine
    running LISP.  If that variable has no value, the name of the host  run-
    ning LISP is used.

    The keyword argument :verbose introduces a flag that  tells  the  system
    whether  or  not  it  should  produce  messages about the state of the X
    server connection at the  time of the restart.  Its  value  defaults  to
    nil.  The :gc-cursor argument tells the system whether to display a spe-
    cial mouse-cursor (shaped like an hourglass) when LISP is  garbage  col-
    lecting.  Doing so tells you why LISP and COMMON WINDOWS have suspended,
    but there is a cost.  LISP has grabbed the mouse and the  mouse  buttons
    will  not  work with other X clients until the cursor changes back.  You
    must weigh the costs and benefits of enabling the gc-cursor..  (You  may
    enable   the   gc-cursor   after   COMMON   WINDOWS   is   running  with
    enable-gc-cursor and disable it with disable-gc-cursor.

    The function restart-common-windows calls the restore  method  on  every
    window-stream  and  bitmap-stream  in  the  restored  environment.   For
    window-streams, the default restore  method  just  calls  repaint.   For
    bitmap-streams,  the  default restore method calls the function restore-
    bitmap-stream which restores the bits on the bitmap stream.  The default
    restore method does not call restore-window-stream, since window-streams
    usually have their own repaint methods.  If this  is  not  the  behavior
    that you want, then you can customize the save and restore methods.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We restart COMMON WINDOWS on host "frigg:0.0"
    (restart-common-windows :host "frigg:0.0")

    ;;  We could have left out the ":0.0", so this call
    ;; has the same effect:
    (restart-common-windows :host "frigg")

    ;;  When :HOST is not specified, the value of the DISPLAY
    ;;  environment variable is used, or the host running
    ;; COMMON WINDOWS 's DISPLAY has no value. There must be an X
    ;; server running on the host.
    (restart-common-windows :host "frigg")

    ;;  We restart COMMON WINDOWS in the verbose mode:

    (restart-common-windows :host "frigg" :verbose t)

    ;; We restart COMMON WINDOWS with the gc-cursor enabled:

    (restart-common-windows :host "frigg" :gc-cursor t)
