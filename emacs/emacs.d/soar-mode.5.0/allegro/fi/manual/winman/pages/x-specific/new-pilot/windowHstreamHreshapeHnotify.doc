    FUNCTION
    window-stream-reshape-notify  -  get the list of functions called by the
      reshape-notify method

    Usage
    window-stream-reshape-notify STREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  the  list  of  functions  that  will   be   called   when   the
    reshape-notify   method   for   the  window-stream  WSTREAM  is  called.
    reshape-notify is called by the system when a common window is  reshaped
    by  the  window manager, not by COMMON WINDOWS itself.  You do not (nor-
    mally) call reshape-notify directly.

    By default the list contains the single function  default-window-stream-
    reshape-notify-method.   This  function does the work of updating COMMON
    WINDOWS about the change in the window, so you should not remove it from
    the list.

    You can change this list by using modify-window-stream-method or replace
    it  entirely  by  using  setf.   If  you  replace the list, be sure that
    default-window-stream-reshape-notify-method.  is in the new  list.   You
    can  restore  the list to its initial state with restore-default-window-
    stream-method

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
      (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
                          :width 200 :height 200
                          :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (defun my-after-reshape-notify (w)
      (format t "Status of window is ~S ~%"
              (window-stream-status w)))

    ;;  The initial list returned contains one function.
    (window-stream-reshape-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-reshape-notify-method)

    ;;  We add a new function.
    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :reshape-notify
                                 :after 'my-after-reshape-notify)
    ;;  Now the list contains two functions.
    (window-stream-reshape-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-reshape-notify-method my-after-reshape-notify)

    ;;  We restore the list to its initial state.
    (restore-window-stream-method *my-win* :reshape-notify)
    (window-stream-reshape-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-reshape-notify-method)
