    METHOD
    reshape-notify  -  method called when X reshapes a window

    Usage
    reshape-notify STREAM REGION

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns   what   the   last   function   in   the   list   returned   by
    window-stream-reshape-notify   returns.    When   the  X  window-manager
    reshapes a common window, it informs COMMON WINDOWS that it has done  so
    to  allow  COMMON  WINDOWS  to  update its information on window status.
    COMMON WINDOWS calls this method, which in turn calls all the  functions
    returned by window-stream-reshape-notify applied to WSTREAM.  You do not
    (normally) call this function directly.

    The initial value of the list returned  by  window-stream-reshape-notify
    contains   the   single  function  default-window-stream-reshape-notify-
    method.  This function does the work of updating COMMON WINDOWS  so  you
    should  not  remove  it from the list.  You may add new functions to the
    list for any window-stream with  modify-window-stream-method.   You  may
    replace the whole list with setf and window-stream-reshape-notify but be
    sure to include default-window-stream-reshape-notify-method in  the  new
    list.   The  function  restore-default-window-stream-method restores the
    list to its original value.

    Any function added to the list must accept  two  arguments,  the  window
    stream and the new region which it occupies.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
                (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
                :width 200 :height 200
                :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (window-stream-reshape-notify *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-reshape-notify-method
              common-windows::reset-right-margin)

    (defun my-before-reshape-notify (w region)
      (declare (ignore region))
      (setf (window-stream-get w 'old-region)
        (window-stream-region w)))

    (defun my-after-reshape-notify (w region)
       (declare (ignore region))
      (reshape w (window-stream-get w 'old-region)))

    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :reshape-notify
                           :after 'my-after-reshape-notify)

    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :reshape-notify
                           :before 'my-before-reshape-notify)
    (window-stream-reshape-notify  *my-win*)
      => (my-before-reshape-notify
           default-window-stream-reshape-notify-method
           common-windows::reset-right-margin my-after-reshape-notify)

    ;;  Now when you use the X window manager to reshape the window,
    ;;  LISP will restore it to its original shape.
