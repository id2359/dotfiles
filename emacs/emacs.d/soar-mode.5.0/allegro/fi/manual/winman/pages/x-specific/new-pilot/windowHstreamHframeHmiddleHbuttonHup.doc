    FUNCTION
    window-stream-frame-middle-button-up  -  get the list of functions
      called by the frame-middle-button-up method

    Usage
    window-stream-frame-middle-button-up WSTREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  the  list  of  functions  that  will   be   called   when   the
    frame-middle-button-up  method  for the window-stream WSTREAM is called.
    This method is called by the system when the middle button  is  released
    in  the  frame  (assuming  the  button was also depressed in the frame).
    But, if the right button menu is installed on WSTREAM, this method  will
    NEVER  be  called by the system since an interactive move is called when
    the middle button is depressed and the button up event is caught by  the
    move.    Therefore,   when   the   right   button   menu  is  installed,
    frame-middle-button-up is inoperative and the list of functions it calls
    is  uninteresting  since  they  will  never be called.  The rest of this
    discussion assumes either that the right button menu is not installed on
    WSTREAM or that the frame-middle-button-down method has been modified so
    that it does NOT contain the function cw::window-stream-middle-down, the
    function that initiates the interactive move.

    With the above in mind, the system calls this  method  when  the  middle
    button  is  released in the frame (assuming it was also depressed in the
    frame).  You do not (normally) call the method directly.

    This list initially contains the single function  default-window-stream-
    middle-button-up-method,  which does nothing except return nil.  You can
    add functions to (or remove  functions  from)  this  list  with  modify-
    window-stream-method.   You  may replace the entire list with this func-
    tion and setf.  restore-default-window-stream-method restores  the  list
    to its initial contents.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We make a window.
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 200
                              :width 100 :height 100
                              :activate-p t))

    ;;  The list contains one function initially.
    (window-stream-frame-left-button-up *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-frame-middle-button-up-method)

    ;;  We add a function to the list.
    (defun my-after-frame-middle-button-up (wstream mouse-state event)
      (declare (ignore event))
          (format  *standard-output*
                   "Position: ~S ~% "
                   (mouse-state-position mouse-state)))

    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :frame-middle-button-up
                                  :after 'my-after-frame-middle-button-up)

    ;;  Now the list contains two functions.
    (window-stream-frame-middle-button-up *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-frame-middle-button-up-method
           my-after-frame-middle-button-up)

    ;;  We restore the list to its initial state.
    (restore-default-window-stream-method *my-win*
      :frame-middle-button-up)
    (window-stream-frame-middle-button-up *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-frame-middle-button-up-method)
