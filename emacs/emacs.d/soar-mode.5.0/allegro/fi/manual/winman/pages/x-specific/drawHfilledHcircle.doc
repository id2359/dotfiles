    FUNCTION
    draw-filled-circle  -  draw a filled circle on a graphic stream

    Usage
    draw-filled-circle GR-STREAM POSITION RADIUS [:color COLOR] [:operation
      OPERATION]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A filled circle  of  radius  RADIUS  is  drawn  on  the  graphic  stream
    GR-STREAM, centered around POSITION.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  The argument RADIUS must be a real  number.  The  argument
    POSITION  determines  a  POSITION  in  the  extent  coordinate system of
    GR-STREAM.  For a function which  passes  the  position  data  structure
    unbundled into its x and y components, see draw-filled-circle-xy.

    The keyword argument :operation specifies  the  boolean  operation  that
    will  be used when the bits from the drawing operation are combined with
    the bits on the graphic stream.  This argument defaults to the value  of
    window-stream-operation  applied to GR-STREAM.  All the sixteen standard
    boolean operations of COMMON LISP are supported.  The  keyword  argument
    :color,  specifies the drawing color, and defaults to the value returned
    by window-stream-foreground-color applied to GR-STREAM.

    The argument GR-STREAM may be either a window-stream  or  bitmap-stream.
    These  are  the  only  two types of graphic streams, with the difference
    between them being that  bitmap-streams  must  be  bitblted  to  window-
    streams.

    The function window-stream-draw-filled-circle returns the list of  func-
    tions  that  this  method calls.  You can change this list by using setf
    and window-stream-draw-filled-circle or by  using  modify-window-stream-
    method.   You  can  restore  the list to its original default state with
    restore-default-window-stream-method.

    The draw-filled-circle method returns what is returned by the last func-
    tion in the list of functions called by the method. If this list has not
    been changed from its initial value, draw-filled-circle returns nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream
           :left 100
           :bottom 100
           :width 300
           :height 300
           :activate-p t :title "A"))

    (draw-filled-circle *my-win*
                (make-position :x 150 :y 150) 50)
