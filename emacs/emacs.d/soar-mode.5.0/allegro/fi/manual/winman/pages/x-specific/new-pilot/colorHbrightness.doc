    FUNCTION
    color-brightness  -  get the brightness of a color

    Usage
    color-brightness COLOR

    DESCRIPTION
    This function returns the brightness component of a color.  In X, colors
    are  composed  of  values  specified for three fields, :red, :green, and
    :blue.   You  may  also  define  color  using  :hue,  :saturation,   and
    :brightness,  or  :gray-level.  However you define a color, it is stored
    as a mixture of red, green, and blue.  The conversion is done  automati-
    cally by COMMON WINDOWS.

    You may also create colors using the values of  :hue,  :saturation,  and
    :brightness,  and  you  may  access the brightness component of a color,
    however it was created.  COMMON WINDOWS will make  the  correct  conver-
    sions to rgb values.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-color*
          (make-color :hue .25 :saturation .75 :brightness .5))
    (color-brightness *my-color*) => 0.5d0
