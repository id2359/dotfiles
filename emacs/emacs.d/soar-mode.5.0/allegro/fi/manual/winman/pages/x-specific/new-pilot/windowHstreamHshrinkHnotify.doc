    FUNCTION
    window-stream-shrink-notify  -  get the list of functions called by the
      shrink-notify method

    Usage
    window-stream-shrink-notify STREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the list of functions that will be called when the shrink-notify
    method for the window-stream WSTREAM is called.  shrink-notify is called
    by the system when a common window is shrunk (to an icon) by the  window
    manager,  not  by  COMMON  WINDOWS  itself.   You do not (normally) call
    shrink-notify directly.

    By default the list contains the single function  default-window-stream-
    shrink-notify-method.   This  function  does the work of updating COMMON
    WINDOWS about the change in the window, so you should not remove it from
    the list.

    You can change this list by using modify-window-stream-method or replace
    it  entirely  by  using  setf.   If  you  replace the list, be sure that
    default-window-stream-shrink-notify-method is in the new list.  You  can
    restore  the  list  to  its  initial  state with restore-default-window-
    stream-method.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
      (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
                          :width 200 :height 200
                          :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (defun my-after-shrink-notify (w)
      (format t "Status of window is ~S ~%"
              (window-stream-status w)))

    ;;  The initial list returned contains one function.
    (window-stream-shrink-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-shrink-notify-method)

    ;;  We add a new function.
    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :shrink-notify
                                 :after 'my-after-shrink-notify)
    ;;  Now the list contains two functions.
    (window-stream-shrink-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-shrink-notify-method my-after-shrink-notify)

    ;;  We restore the list to its initial state.
    (restore-window-stream-method *my-win* :shrink-notify)
    (window-stream-shrink-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-shrink-notify-method)
