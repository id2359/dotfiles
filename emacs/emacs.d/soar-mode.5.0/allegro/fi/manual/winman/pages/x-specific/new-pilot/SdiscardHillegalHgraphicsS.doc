    VARIABLE
    *discard-illegal-graphics*  -  flag to tell X to ignore out-of-bounds
      graphics operations

    DESCRIPTION
    In theory, you should be able to specify any point in the  extent  to  a
    drawing  routine, so long as the x and y coordinates are less than most-
    positive-fixnum.  In practice, very large numbers sometimes confuse  the
    server and generate an error. (The error may come, for example, when the
    server tries to store the value as a 16 bit integer.  Such values can be
    no  larger  than around 64,000.) This global variable is bound to a flag
    that, if true, tells  COMMON  WINDOWS  (and  the  server)  will  try  to
    suppress errors caused by locations that are out of bounds.  If the flag
    is false (nil) errors may be generated.

    We cannot guarantee that all such errors will be suppressed  by  setting
    this  flag to true.  Most, however, should be suppressed.  (We do recom-
    mend NOT trying to write graphics that are way out of bounds as a better
    solution, of course.)

    The initial value of this variable is nil.

    EXAMPLES
    <cl>  *DISCARD-ILLEGAL-GRAPHICS*
    nil
    <cl> (SETQ W (MAKE-WINDOW-STREAM :ACTIVATE-P T))
    #<window stream @ #x709cc1>
    <cl> (DRAW-POINT-XY W 100000 100000)
    Error: the value of x-common-windows::object is 100000, ...
    Restart actions (select using :continue):
     0: supply a new value of x-common-windows::object.
    [1] <cl> :RESET
    <cl> (SETQ *DISCARD-ILLEGAL-GRAPHICS* T)
    t
    <cl> (DRAW-POINT-XY W 100000 100000)
    nil
    <cl>
