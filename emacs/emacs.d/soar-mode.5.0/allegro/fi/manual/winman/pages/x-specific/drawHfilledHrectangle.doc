    FUNCTION
    draw-filled-rectangle  -  draw a filled rectangle on a graphic stream

    Usage
    draw-filled-rectangle GR-STREAM POSITION WIDTH HEIGHT [:color COLOR]
      [:operation OPERATION]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A filled rectangle of dimensions  WIDTH  and  HEIGHT  is  drawn  on  the
    graphic stream GR-STREAM, with the lower left-hand corner at POSITION.

    The following description applies to which edges of the figure  actually
    get drawn: If the interior of the rectangle lies to the left of the edge
    then this edge will not be drawn. A horizontal edge which lies above the
    interior  of  the  rectangle  rectangle will not be drawn.  Vertices are
    only drawn when both adjacent edges are drawn.   Leaving  edges  out  in
    this  way  allows a window to be tiled with the rectangle without double
    covering of edges.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  The arguments WIDTH and  HEIGHT  must  be  integers.   The
    argument  POSITION determines a POSITION in the extent coordinate system
    of GR-STREAM.  For a function which passes the position  data  structure
    unbundled into its x and y components, see draw-filled-rectangle-xy.

    The keyword argument :operation specifies  the  boolean  operation  that
    will  be used when the bits from the drawing operation are combined with
    the bits on the graphic stream.  This argument defaults to the value  of
    window-stream-operation  applied to GR-STREAM.  All the sixteen standard
    boolean operations of COMMON LISP are supported.  The  keyword  argument
    :color,  specifies the drawing color, and defaults to the value returned
    by window-stream-foreground-color applied to GR-STREAM.

    The argument GR-STREAM may be either a window-stream  or  bitmap-stream.
    These  are  the  only  two types of graphic streams, with the difference
    between them being that  bitmap-streams  must  be  bitblted  to  window-
    streams.

    The function window-stream-draw-filled-rectangle  returns  the  list  of
    functions  that  this  method  calls.  You can change this list by using
    setf and window-stream-draw-filled-rectangle or by using  modify-window-
    stream-method.   You  can restore the list to its original default state
    with restore-default-window-stream-method.

    The draw-filled-rectangle method returns what is returned  by  the  last
    function in the list of functions called by the method. If this list has
    not been changed from its initial value,  draw-filled-rectangle  returns
    nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream
           :left 100
           :bottom 300
           :width 300
           :height 300
           :activate-p t))

    (draw-filled-rectangle *my-win*
                        (make-position :x 150 :y 150)
                        50 100)
