    VARIABLE
    *restart-common-windows-actions*  -  list of functions called by
      restart-common-windows

    DESCRIPTION
    Bound to the list of functions that are called, in order, when  restart-
    common-windows  is  called.   (Actually,  the  list contains the symbols
    which denote the functions, not the function  objects  themselves.)  The
    functions  are  called  with  the  arguments  passed  to restart-common-
    windows.

    The initial value of this variable is the  list  containing  the  single
    function default-restart-common-windows.  This function does the work of
    restarting COMMON WINDOWS so it MUST be in the  list.   You  should  add
    other  functions  with push or append and remove them with remove.  (You
    may replace the entire list, of  course,  so  long  as  default-restart-
    common-windows is included.)

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The default value of the list:
    *restart-common-windows-actions* => (default-restart-common-windows)
    ;;  We define another function and add it to the list:
    (defun my-res (&rest args) (declare (ignore args))
      (format t "Restarting Common Windows Now.~%"))
    (push 'my-res *restart-common-windows-actions*)
    *restart-common-windows-actions*
      => (my-res default-restart-common-windows)

    *make-window-stream-actions*, restart-common-windows
