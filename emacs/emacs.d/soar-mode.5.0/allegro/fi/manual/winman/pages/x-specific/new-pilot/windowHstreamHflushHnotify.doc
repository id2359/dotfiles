    FUNCTION
    window-stream-flush-notify  -  get the list of functions called by the
      flush-notify method

    Usage
    window-stream-flush-notify STREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the list of functions that will be called when the  flush-notify
    method  for the window-stream WSTREAM is called.  flush-notify is called
    by the system when a common window is buried by the window manager,  not
    by  COMMON  WINDOWS  itself.   You  do  not (normally) call flush-notify
    directly.

    By default the list contains the single function  default-window-stream-
    flush-notify-method.   This  function  does  the work of updating COMMON
    WINDOWS about the change in the window, so you should not remove it from
    the list.

    You can change this list by using modify-window-stream-method or replace
    it  entirely  by  using  setf.   If  you  replace the list, be sure that
    default-window-stream-flush-notify-method.  is in the new list.  You can
    restore  the  list  to  its  initial  state with restore-default-window-
    stream-method

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
      (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
                          :width 200 :height 200
                          :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (defun my-after-flush-notify (w)
      (format *terminal-io* "A window has been flushed.~%"))

    ;;  The initial list returned contains one function.
    (window-stream-flush-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-flush-notify-method)

    ;;  We add a new function.
    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :flush-notify
                                 :after 'my-after-flush-notify)
    ;;  Now the list contains two functions.
    (window-stream-flush-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-flush-notify-method my-after-flush-notify)

    ;;  We restore the list to its initial state.
    (restore-window-stream-method *my-win* :flush-notify)
    (window-stream-flush-notify  *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-flush-notify-method)
