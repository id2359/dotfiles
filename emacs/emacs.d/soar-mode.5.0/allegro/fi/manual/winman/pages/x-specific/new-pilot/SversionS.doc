    VARIABLE
    *version*  -  the version number of the running COMMON WINDOWS

    DESCRIPTION
    Bound to a string identifying the version  of  the  currently  installed
    COMMON  WINDOWS.   Do not change the value of this variable.  Be sure to
    include the version number (the value  of  this  variable)  in  any  bug
    report, question, or other communication concerning COMMON WINDOWS.

    The function common-windows-version returns the same string.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Evaluate this variable when you create a dribble file for
    ;;  bug reporting.  The function DRIBBLE-BUG writes other useful

    (dribble-bug "my-bug")
    *version*
