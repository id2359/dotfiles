    FUNCTION
    window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor  -  get the mouse cursor associated

    Usage

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the mouse cursor object associated with the frame of the  window
    stream  WSTREAM.  This mouse cursor will be displayed when the cursor is
    moved into this the frame of the window.

    The frame of a window-stream is the area that includes the title  region
    and the borders.

    The default value returned by this function is the bullseye  mouse  cur-

    mouse cursor for the frame can be specified when the window  is  created

    make-window-stream.  The cursor can be changed after the window has been
    created with this function and setf.

    (setf *my-win*
              (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 200
                                  :width 100 :height 100
                                  :activate-p t :title "My Window"))
    ;;  The frame mouse cursor is the bullseye.
    (eq (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor *my-win*)
        *mouse-cursor-bullseye*) => t

    ;;  We can change the frame mouse cursor with SETF.
