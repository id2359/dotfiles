    VARIABLE
    *make-window-stream-actions*  -  list of functions called by after a
      window is created with make-window-stream

    DESCRIPTION
    Bound  to  a  list  of  functions  which  are  called,  in  order,  when
    make-window-stream  finishes  making  a  window-stream and returns.  The
    functions are called with the new window-stream as  the  only  argument.
    (Actually, the list contains the symbols which denote the functions, not
    the function objects themselves.)

    The initial value of this variable is the  list  containing  the  single
    function  add-right-button-menu.   This  function  adds the right button
    menu to the newly created window-stream.  If you do not what  the  right
    button  menu  added to a particular window-stream, bind this variable to
    nil  (or  some  other  list   of   functions)   during   the   call   to
    make-window-stream.   Replace  the  list entirely if you do not want the
    right button menu on any window.  Use push or append to add functions to
    the list while leaving add-right-button-menu.

    Note that the right button menu interferes with or makes inoperable most
    frame  button  methods.   (E.g.  frame-middle-button-up and frame-right-
    button-up are both rendered  inoperative.   See  the  entries  on  these
    methods for details.)

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The default value of the list:
    *make-window-stream-actions* => (add-right-button-menu)
    ;;  To make a window without the right button menu:
    (let ((*make-window-stream-actions* nil))
      (make-window-stream))
    ;;  We define another function and add it to the list:
    (defun my-mws (&rest args) (declare (ignore args))
      (format t "New window just created.~%"))
    (push 'my-res *make-window-stream-actions*)
    *make-window-stream-actions*
      => (my-mws add-right-button-menu)
