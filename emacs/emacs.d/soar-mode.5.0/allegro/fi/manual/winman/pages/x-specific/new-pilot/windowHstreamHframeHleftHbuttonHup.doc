    FUNCTION
    window-stream-frame-left-button-up  -  get the list of functions called
      by the frame-left-button-up method

    Usage
    window-stream-frame-left-button-up WSTREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  the  list  of  functions  that  will   be   called   when   the
    frame-left-button-up  method  for  the  window-stream WSTREAM is called.
    The system calls this method when the left button  is  released  in  the
    frame  (assuming  it was also depressed in the frame).  You do not (nor-
    mally) call the method directly.

    This list initially contains the single function  default-window-stream-
    left-button-up-method,  which  does  nothing except return nil.  You can
    add functions to (or remove  functions  from)  this  list  with  modify-
    window-stream-method.   You  may replace the entire list with this func-
    tion and setf.  restore-default-window-stream-method restores  the  list
    to its initial contents.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We make a window.
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 200
                              :width 100 :height 100
                              :activate-p t))

    ;;  The list contains one function initially.
    (window-stream-frame-left-button-up *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-frame-left-button-up-method)

    ;;  We add a function to the list.
    (defun my-after-frame-left-button-up (wstream mouse-state event)
      (declare (ignore event))
          (format  *standard-output*
                   "Position: ~S ~% "
                   (mouse-state-position mouse-state)))

    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :frame-left-button-up
                                  :after 'my-after-frame-left-button-up)

    ;;  Now the list contains two functions.
    (window-stream-frame-left-button-up *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-frame-left-button-up-method
           my-after-frame-left-button-up)

    ;;  We restore the list to its initial state.
    (restore-default-window-stream-method *my-win*
      :frame-left-button-up)
    (window-stream-frame-left-button-up *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-frame-left-button-up-method)
