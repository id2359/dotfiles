    MACRO
    with-graphics-batching  -  buffer some graphic commands for the X server

    Usage
    with-graphics-batching {FORM}*

    SIDE EFFECTS
    For the (dynamic) duration of the with-graphics-batching form, each FORM
    that  is  a graphics operation is buffered.  The graphics operations are
    sent to X when Lisp's buffer fills up, or immediately when  the  dynami-
    cally  outermost  with-graphics-batching  is  exited, either normally or
    abnormally.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the last FORM.  When with-graphics-batching is  not  in  effect,
    each  graphics  operation  is  sent  to X immediately without buffering.
    When a lot of graphics is being done, this macro  speeds  up  processing
    significantly.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
            (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
            :width 200 :height 200
            :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (with-graphics-batching
     (dotimes (i 50)
              (draw-point *my-win*
                          (make-position :x (* 2 i)
                                         :y (* 2 i))))
     (draw-circle-xy *my-win* 50 50 30))
