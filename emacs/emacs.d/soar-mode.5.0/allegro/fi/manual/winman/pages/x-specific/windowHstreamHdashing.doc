    FUNCTION
    window-stream-dashing  -  get the default dashing pattern for a
      graphics-stream

    Usage
    window-stream-dashing GR-STREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the default dashing  pattern  of  GR-STREAM,  which  must  be  a
    window-stream  or  a  bitmap-stream.   this  pattern will be used as the
    value of the :dashing keyword argument when it is  unspecified  for  all
    drawing  functions that take a dashing argument when they are applied to
    GR-STREAM.  The dashing pattern may be a list of  positive  integers,  a
    positive  integer,  or  nil.   nil indicates that a solid line should be
    used. nil is the initial value of this function.  The value returned may
    be changed with setf.

    When not nil, the :dashing keyword argument of  a  drawing  function  is
    interepreted  as  follows.   If  it  is a list, it specifies the dashing
    pattern by saying how many pixels should be on and  off.   For  example,
    the dashing pattern (1 2 3 4) says that one bit should be turned on fol-
    lowed by 2 bits turned off followed by 3 bits turned on  followed  by  4
    bits  turned  off,  and then the pattern repeated throughout the drawing
    operation.  If the length of the list is odd, then the  dashing  pattern
    cycles.   For example the list (1 2 3) would produce the dashing pattern
    (1 on, 2 off, 3 on)  (1 off, 2 on, 3 off), etc.  A dashing pattern  that
    consists  of  a  single  integer is a shorthand for the integer repeated
    twice in the usual list representation.  For example, if DASHING  is  2,
    then this is equivalent to the dashing pattern (22).

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
            (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 100
            :width 200 :height 200
            :activate-p t :title "Just a Window"))

    (window-stream-dashing *my-win*) =>  nil
    (setq (window-stream-dashing *my-win*) '(1 2 3 4))
    (window-stream-dashing *my-win*) =>  (1 2 3 4)
