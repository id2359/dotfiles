    FUNCTION
    active-region-mouse-cursor-move  -  get the list of functions called by
      mouse-cursor-move method

    Usage
    active-region-mouse-cursor-move AREGION

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  the  list  of  functions  that  will   be   called   when   the
    mouse-cursor-move  method  for the active-region AREGION is called.  You
    can replace this list by using setf,  or  modify  it  by  using  modify-
    active-region-method.    Use   restore-default-active-region-method   to
    restore the list to its default contents.  The default mouse-cursor-move
    method   calls   the  function  default-active-region-mouse-cursor-move-
    method.  The default method does nothing at all.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We make a window.
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 200
                              :width 100 :height 100
                              :activate-p t))
    ;;  We put an active-region in it.
    (setf *my-active*
          (make-active-region
           :left 0 :bottom 0 :width 100 :height 100
           :parent *my-win*
           :activate-p t
           ))

    (defun my-after-mouse-cursor-move (aregion mouse-state event)
          (format  *standard-output*
                   "Position: ~S ~% "
                   (mouse-state-position mouse-state)))
    (modify-active-region-method *my-active* :mouse-cursor-move
                                  :after 'my-after-mouse-cursor-move)

    ;;  Now whenever the mouse cursor moves within *my-active*,
    ;;  we can monitor the mouse position .

    ;;  We look at the list of functions.

    (active-region-mouse-cursor-move *my-active*)
      => (default-window-stream-mouse-cursor-move-method
          my-after-mouse-cursor-move)
