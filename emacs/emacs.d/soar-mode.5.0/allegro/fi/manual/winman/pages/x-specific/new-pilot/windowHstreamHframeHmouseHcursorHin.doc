    FUNCTION
    window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-in  -  get the list of functions called
      by the frame-mouse-cursor-in method

    Usage
    window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-in WSTREAM

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  the  list  of  functions  that  will   be   called   when   the
    frame-mouse-cursor-in  method  for  the window-stream WSTREAM is called.
    The system calls this function when the mouse cursor enters  the  window
    frame  (the  borders  and  title  region) from OUTSIDE the window.  (The
    method is NOT called when the cursor enters the frame  from  within  the
    window.) You do not (normally) call this function directly.

    Initially, the list of functions contains the single  function  default-
    window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-in-method.     This   function   simply
    returns nil.  You can add functions to (or remove functions  from)  this
    list  with modify-window-stream-method.  You can replace the entire list
    with  window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-in  and  setf.   restore-default-
    window-stream-method restores the list to its initial contents.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We make a window.
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 200
                              :width 100 :height 100
                              :activate-p t))
    ;;  The list contains one function.
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-in *my-win*) =>
    (default-window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-in-method)

    ;;  We add another function to the list.
    (defun my-after-frame-mouse-cursor-in (wstream mouse-state event)
      (declare (ignore event))
          (format  *standard-output*
                   "Position: ~S ~% "
                   (mouse-state-position mouse-state)))

    (modify-window-stream-method *my-win* :frame-mouse-cursor-in
                                  :after 'my-after-frame-mouse-cursor-in)

    ;;  The list now contains two functions.
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-in *my-win*)
      => (default-window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-in-method
              my-after-frame-mouse-cursor-in)

    ;;  We restore the list to its initial state.
    (restore-default-window-stream-method *my-win* :frame-mouse-cursor-in)
    (window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-in *my-win*) =>
    (default-window-stream-frame-mouse-cursor-in-method)
