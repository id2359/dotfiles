    FUNCTION
    color-hue  -  get the hue of a color

    Usage
    color-hue COLOR

    DESCRIPTION
    This function returns the hue component of a color.  In  X,  colors  are
    composed  of values specified for three fields, :red, :green, and :blue.
    You may also define color using :hue, :saturation, and  :brightness,  or
    :gray-level.   However  you define a color, it is stored as a mixture of
    red, green, and blue.  The conversion is done  automatically  by  COMMON
    WINDOWS.

    You may also create colors using the values of  :hue,  :saturation,  and
    :brightness, and you may access the hue component of a color, however it
    was created.  COMMON WINDOWS will make the correct  conversions  to  rgb
    values.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-color*
          (make-color-hsb :hue .25 :saturation .50 :brightness .75))
    (color-hue *my-color*) => 0.25d0
