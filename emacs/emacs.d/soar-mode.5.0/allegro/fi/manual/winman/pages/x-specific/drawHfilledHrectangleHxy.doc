    FUNCTION
    draw-filled-rectangle-xy  -  draw a filled rectangle on a graphic stream

    Usage
    draw-filled-rectangle-xy GR-STREAM X Y WIDTH HEIGHT [:color COLOR]
      [:operation OPERATION]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A filled rectangle of dimensions  WIDTH  and  HEIGHT  is  drawn  on  the
    graphic  stream  GR-STREAM, with the lower left-hand corner at the posi-
    tion determined by X and Y.

    The following description applies to which edges of the figure  actually
    get drawn: If the interior of the rectangle lies to the left of the edge
    then this edge will not be drawn. A horizontal edge which lies above the
    interior  of  the  rectangle  rectangle will not be drawn.  Vertices are
    only drawn when both adjacent edges are drawn.   Leaving  edges  out  in
    this  way  allows a window to be tiled with the rectangle without double
    covering of edges.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  The arguments WIDTH and HEIGHT must be integers. The argu-
    ments  X  and  Y  determine the x and y coordinates of a POSITION in the
    extent coordinate system of GR-STREAM.  For a function which passes  the
    position  data  structure directly, instead of its components, see draw-
    filled-rectangle.

    The keyword argument :operation specifies  the  boolean  operation  that
    will  be used when the bits from the drawing operation are combined with
    the bits on the graphic stream.  This argument defaults to the value  of
    window-stream-operation  applied to GR-STREAM.  All the sixteen standard
    boolean operations of COMMON LISP are supported.  The  keyword  argument
    :color,  specifies  the  drawing  color,  and if not specified, uses the
    color returned by window-stream-foreground-color.

    The argument GR-STREAM may be either a window-stream  or  bitmap-stream.
    These  are  the  only  two types of graphic streams, with the difference
    between them being that  bitmap-streams  must  be  bitblted  to  window-
    streams.

    The function window-stream-draw-filled-rectangle-xy returns the list  of
    functions  that  this  method  calls.  You can change this list by using
    setf and  window-stream-draw-filled-rectangle-xy  or  by  using  modify-
    window-stream-method.   You can restore the list to its original default
    state with restore-default-window-stream-method.

    The draw-filled-rectangle-xy method returns what is returned by the last
    function in the list of functions called by the method. If this list has
    not  been  changed  from  its  initial  value,  draw-filled-rectangle-xy
    returns nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream
           :left 100
           :bottom 300
           :width 300
           :height 300
           :activate-p t))

    (draw-filled-rectangle-xy *my-win*
                           150  150
                           50 100)
