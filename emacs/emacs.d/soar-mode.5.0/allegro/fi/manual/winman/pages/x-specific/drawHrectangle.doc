    FUNCTION
    draw-rectangle  -  draw a rectangle on a graphic stream

    Usage
    draw-rectangle GR-STREAM POSITION WIDTH HEIGHT [:brush-width BRUSH-
      WIDTH] [:color COLOR] [:dashing DASHING] [:operation OPERATION]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A rectangle of dimensions WIDTH and  HEIGHT  is  drawn  on  the  graphic
    stream  GR-STREAM,  with  the  lower left-hand corner at POSITION.  This
    position is given with respect to extent coordinates.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  For a function which passes the  position  data  structure
    unbundled into its x and y components, see draw-rectangle-xy.

    The keyword argument :brush-width is the width, in pixels, of the points
    that  are drawn.  The default value is the value of window-stream-brush-
    width applied to gr-stream.  The keyword argument  :operation  specifies
    the  boolean  operation that will be used when the bits from the drawing
    operation are combined with the bits on the graphic stream.  This  argu-
    ment  defaults  to  the  value  of  window-stream-operation  applied  to
    GR-STREAM.  All the sixteen standard boolean operations of  COMMON  LISP
    are  supported.   The  keyword  argument  :color,  specifies the drawing
    color, and defaults to the value returned  by  window-stream-foreground-
    color applied to GR-STREAM.

    The keyword argument :dashing is a  list  which  specifies  the  dashing
    pattern  of  the  rectangle.  For example, the dashing pattern (1 2 3 4)
    says that one bit should be turned on followed by 2 bits turned off fol-
    lowed  by  3  bits turned on followed by 4 bits turned off, and then the
    pattern repeated throughout the drawing operation.  If the length of the
    list is odd, then the dashing pattern cycles.  For example the list (1 2
    3) would produce the dashing pattern (1 on, 2 off, 3 on)  (1 off, 2  on,
    3  off),  etc.  A dashing pattern that consists of a single integer is a
    shorthand for the integer repeated twice in the usual  list  representa-
    tion.   For  example,  if  DASHING  is 2, then this is equivalent to the
    dashing pattern (22).

    The argument GR-STREAM may be either a window-stream  or  bitmap-stream.
    These  are  the  only  two types of graphic streams, with the difference
    between them being that  bitmap-streams  must  be  bitblted  to  window-
    streams.

    The function window-stream-draw-rectangle returns the list of  functions
    that  this  method  calls.   You  can change this list by using setf and
    window-stream-draw-rectangle or  by  using  modify-window-stream-method.
    You  can  restore  the  list to its original default state with restore-
    default-window-stream-method.

    The draw-rectangle method returns what is returned by the last  function
    in the list of functions called by the method. If this list has not been
    changed from its initial value, draw-rectangle returns nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
          (make-window-stream
           :left 100
           :bottom 300
           :width 300
           :height 300
           :activate-p t))

    (draw-rectangle *my-win*
                (make-position :x 150 :y 150)
                50 100
                :brush-width 2
                )
