    FUNCTION
    installed-fonts  -  get a list describing the installed fonts

    Usage
    installed-fonts

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a list of alists describing the fonts installed in  COMMON  WIN-
    DOWS.   The  values  in  the alist are set up when the font is installed
    with install-font.  The list is very long.  We  recommend  using  pprint
    and dribble to print the list to a file where it can be examined at lei-
    sure.  The examples show how to create such a file.

    Note that fonts do not have to be installed to be used.   Fonts  may  be
    opened  directly  using only the server name with open-font-named.  (The
    related function open-font opens installed fonts only.)  Also, the func-
    tion  font-attributes applied to a server name returns a different alist
    generated by parsing the server name.  If you are expert  in  fonts  and
    know  exactly what you want, you probably should use open-font-named and
    font-attributes.  If you are less experienced with fonts and want to see
    what is available, examine the list returned by this function.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Evaluating the following forms will cause the list
    ;;  returned by INSTALLED-FONTS to be written is a pretty
    ;;  format to the file font.file.
    (dribble "font.file")
    (pprint (installed-fonts))
    (dribble)
