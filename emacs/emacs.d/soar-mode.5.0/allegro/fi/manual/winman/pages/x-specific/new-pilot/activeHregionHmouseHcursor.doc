    FUNCTION
    active-region-mouse-cursor  -  the mouse cursor associated with an
      active-region

    Usage
    active-region-mouse-cursor ACTIVE-REGION

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns  the  mouse   cursor   associated   with   the   active   region
    ACTIVE-REGION.  This is the mouse cursor that will be displayed when the
    cursor is moved into this region.  The default value is the same  cursor
    as returned by window-stream-mouse-cursor.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *my-win*
              (make-window-stream :left 100 :bottom 200
                                  :width 100 :height 100
                                  :activate-p t))
    ;; put an active-region in it
    (setf *my-active*
              (make-active-region
               :left 0 :bottom 0 :width 50 :height 50
               :parent *my-win*
               :activate-p t
               ))

    (eq (window-stream-mouse-cursor *my-win*)
        (active-region-mouse-cursor *my-active*)) => t

    (setf (active-region-mouse-cursor *my-active*) *mouse-cursor-+*)
    ;; Now whenever you move the mouse cursor into the active region, the
    ;; cursor will change to a `+'.
