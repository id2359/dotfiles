    FUNCTION
    sxhash  -  get a hash code for an object

    USAGE
    sxhash object

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a non-negative fixnum that may  be  used  as  a  hash  code  for
    OBJECT,  which  may  be  any  COMMON  LISP object.  The code returned is
    implementation-dependent, but, guaranteed to be independent of different
    incarnations  or  core images of the same implementation.  Thus the code
    can be written to a file, read in later by a fresh copy of COMMON  LISP,
    and  used  meaningfully.   The  code  returned  is  the same for any two
    objects that are equal.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x '(a b c)) => (a b c)
    (equal (sxhash x) (sxhash (copy-list x)))  => t
