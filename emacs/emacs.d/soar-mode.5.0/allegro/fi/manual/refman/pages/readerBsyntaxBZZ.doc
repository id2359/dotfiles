    READER SYNTAX
    "  -  representation of a simple string

    Usage
    "..."

    DESCRIPTION
    Reads as a simple string.

    When the reader reads the character ``"'',  it  is  discarded,  and  the
    reader begins to accumulate succeeding characters for a (simple) string.
    If the escape character ``\'' is read, it is  discarded,  and  the  next
    character  is  accumulated, even if it is a ``"''.  If the string delim-
    iter ``"'' is read, it is discarded, accumulation stops, and the  resul-
    tant string of accumulated characters is returned.

    Strings are self-evaluating objects.

    EXAMPLES
    (read-from-string "\"\\\"string\\\" in a string\"")
      => "\"string\" in a string" 24

    (princ "\"string\" in a string")
      PRINTS "string" in a string
