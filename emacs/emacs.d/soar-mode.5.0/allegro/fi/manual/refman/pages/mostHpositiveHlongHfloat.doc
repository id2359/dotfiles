    CONSTANT
    most-positive-long-float  -  the long-float closest to positive infinity

    DESCRIPTION
    This constant evaluates to the value of the long-float number nearest to
    (but   still   different   from)   positive  infinity.   This  value  is
    implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  This value is implementation-dependent.
    most-positive-long-float => 4.4942328371557866d+307
