    SPECIAL FORM
    tagbody  -  set up an environment allowing gotos

    USAGE
    tagbody {tag | stmt}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil after the  last  STMT  is  processed.   The  statements  are
    evaluated  sequentially,  except for symbols and integers, which are not
    evaluated but serve as tags.  Anywhere within the tagbody, a  label  may
    be  jumped  to  by means of go.  The scope of the labels in a tagbody is
    lexical, and their extent is dynamic.  A label in a tagbody  shadows  an
    identical  label in an outer tagbody.  A go to a label transfers control
    to the innermost lexically-visible such label.

    Some COMMON LISP forms, including do, do*, dotimes,  dolist,  prog,  and
    prog* provide an implicit tagbody around their body forms.

    EXAMPLES
    (let ((x 0))
      (tagbody loop (incf x)(if (< x 10)(go loop)))x ) => 10

    (let ((x 0))
      (tagbody
         (apply #'(lambda (num) (if (= num 0) (go loop1) (go loop2)))
                (list x))
       loop1 (setq x 5) (go end)
       loop2 (setq x 10)
       end)
      x) => 5
