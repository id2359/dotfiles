    MACRO
    prog1  -  evaluate forms sequentially, returning exactly one value from
      the first

    USAGE
    prog1 first-form {form}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a single value from the result  of  evaluating  FIRST-FORM,  and
    evaluates  all  of the arguments sequentially.  prog1 is useful when you
    wish to evaluate forms for their side effects, getting  a  value  before
    they take effect.

    prog1 returns exactly one value.  If the  first  form  returns  multiple
    values,  all  but  the  first are ignored.  If the first form returns no
    values, nil is returned.  (Use  multiple-value-prog1  if  you  want  all
    values of the first form.)

    EXAMPLES
    (prog1 (setq x 5) (incf x)) => 5
    x => 6
    (prog1 (values)) => nil
    (prog1 (truncate 1.3)) => 1
    ;;  Contrast the last example with progn:
    (progn (truncate 1.3)) => 1 0.3
