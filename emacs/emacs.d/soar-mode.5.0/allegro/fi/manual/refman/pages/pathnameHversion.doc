    FUNCTION
    pathname-version  -  get the version component of a pathname

    USAGE
    pathname-version path

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the version component of PATH.  The version is one  of  the  six
    components  of  a  pathname (the other five are device, directory, host,
    name, and type).  PATH must be a pathname, string,  symbol,  or  stream.
    If PATH is a stream, it must be, or have been, open to a file.

    The version component of a pathname is implementation-dependent, but  is
    always  an  integer  or  a  distinguished symbol.  If it is a number, it
    corresponds to the  version  number  of  the  file.  (COMMON  LISP:  THE
    LANGUAGE specifies that a numeric version component should be a positive
    integer.  Some implementations permit nonpositive integers.)  The  value
    indicates that the version component is missing, which may mean that the
    host file system does not support multiple versions  of  a  file.   When
    reading  a  file, :newest corresponds to the largest version number that
    already exists for that file.  However, when  writing  a  file,  :newest
    corresponds  to  a  version number greater than any already existing for
    that file.  The only other version component for which meaning is speci-
    fied  by the language is :wild.  It `matches' any version component when
    used in directory-search operations such as that performed by directory.
    Implementations  may  provide  other  symbols or nonpositive integers to
    specify versions.  Symbols suggested are :oldest  (that  file  with  the
    smallest  version  number),  :previous  (the one before the newest), and
    :installed (the official version).

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following example refers to a file on a VMS file system.
    (pathname-version "pleiades::sys$sysdisk:[sys0.sysexe]lisp.exe;0")
      => :newest
