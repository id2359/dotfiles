    FUNCTION
    gentemp  -  create a new interned symbol

    USAGE
    gentemp [prefix [package]]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a new interned symbol.  The symbol is interned  in  the  package
    specified  by  the  package PACKAGE.  The symbol has a unique print name
    among symbols accessible in PACKAGE.  The print  name  consists  of  the
    string  PREFIX followed by the decimal representation of the value of an
    internal counter.  The value of PACKAGE defaults to the current package.
    The value of PREFIX defaults to the string "T".

    This function guarantees that the symbol returned is unique in  PACKAGE.
    First  a print name is generated by concatenating PREFIX and the decimal
    representation of the value of the internal counter.   If  a  symbol  by
    this name is accessible in PACKAGE, the counter is incremented and a new
    print name is generated.  This process is repeated until a  unique  name
    is  found.   A  new  symbol  object  is created with the unique name and
    interned in PACKAGE.  The value of the internal counter  may  be  incre-
    mented by at least one each time gentemp is called.  The precise details
    of when the  counter  is  incremented  is  implementation-dependent:  an
    implementation  needs  only  to  guarantee  that  the returned symbol is
    unique using an algorithm involving incrementing of  the  counter.   The
    value of the counter is always an integer greater than or equal to zero.

    This function differs from the related function gensym in several  ways.
    The  symbol-name  prefix  is  not  remembered  across  calls:  it always
    defaults to "T" unless explicitly specified.   It  is  not  possible  to
    change the value of the internal counter.  And this function interns the
    symbol it creates.  (It is because of this that a unique print name must
    be generated.)

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  In the following examples, the value of the counter may
    ;;  differ from what you will get.  We assume that symbols
    ;;  with the returned print names do not already exist.
    ;;  In this implementation, the counter is not incremented
    ;;  by a call to GENTEMP unless necessary.
    (gentemp) => t21
    (gentemp "TEMP") => temp21
    (gentemp) => t22
