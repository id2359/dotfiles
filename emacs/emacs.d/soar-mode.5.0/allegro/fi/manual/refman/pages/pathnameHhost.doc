    FUNCTION
    pathname-host  -  get the host component of a pathname

    USAGE
    pathname-host path

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the host component of PATH.  The host is one  of  the  six  com-
    ponents of a pathname (the other five are device, directory, name, type,
    and version).  PATH must be a pathname, string, symbol, or stream.   (If
    PATH is a stream, it must be, or have been, open to a file.)

    The host component of a pathname is implementation-dependent, but may be
    a string, a list of strings, nil, or :wild.  nil indicates that the host
    is unspecified; :wild is a host component that `matches' any  host  when
    the  pathname it appears in is used in a directory-search operation such
    as that performed by directory.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following example refers to a file on a VMS file system.
    (pathname-host "pleiades::sys$sysdisk:[sys0.sysexe]lisp.exe;0")
      => "PLEIADES"
