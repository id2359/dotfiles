    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~*  -  skip backward or forward in argument list

    USAGE
    ~count[:][@]&ESTAR

    DESCRIPTION
    Skips forward over COUNT (default 1) format arguments, unless the  ``:''
    modifier  is  given,  in  which case the skipping is backward.  When the
    ``@'' modifier is given, skipping is absolute  in  the  sense  that  the
    argument numbered COUNT (default 0) becomes available to the next direc-
    tive in the format control string.  The first argument is numbered zero.

    Within the repetition control structure directive, ``~{'',  this  direc-
    tive  skips forward, backward, or absolutely within the sublist of argu-
    ments being processed by the iteration.

    EXAMPLES
    (format nil "~B ~:*~O ~:*~D ~:*~X" 13)
      => "1101 15 13 d"
    (format nil "~3@*~A ~V@*~A ~2*~A" 'a 'b 'c 'd 2 'e)
      => "d c e"
