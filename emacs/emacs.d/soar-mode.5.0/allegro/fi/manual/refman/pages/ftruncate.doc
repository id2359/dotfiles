    FUNCTION
    ftruncate  -  truncate and convert to floating-point number

    USAGE
    ftruncate number [divisor]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns two values, Q and R.  Q is  the  result  of  of  truncating  the
    quotient  of  NUMBER and DIVISOR toward 0, coerced to a float.  R is the
    difference between NUMBER and Q times DIVISOR.  That is,

    r = NUMBER - q*DIVISOR

    The result of truncating a number toward 0 is the  largest  non-negative
    integer  less  than  or equal to a positive number and the smallest non-
    positive integer greater than or equal to a negative number.

    If DIVISOR is not specified, it defaults to 1.  In that case, the  trun-
    cation of NUMBER, coerced to a float, is returned as the first value.

    The first returned value is coerced to a float of  the  same  format  as
    NUMBER  (to  a  single-float  if NUMBER is rational).  The format of the
    second returned value follows  the  rules  of  floating-point  contagion
    (applied before Q is converted to a float).  Therefore, the second value
    may be an integer if both of the arguments are integers.

    Both  arguments  must  be  real  numbers,  either  integer  rational  or
    floating-point.

    EXAMPLES
    (ftruncate 5.3) => 5.0 0.3
    (ftruncate 5 2) => 2.0 1
    (ftruncate -5 2) => -2.0 -1
    (ftruncate -5.2 2) => -2.0 -1.2
