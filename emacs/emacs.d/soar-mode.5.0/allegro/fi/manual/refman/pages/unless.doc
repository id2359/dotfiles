    MACRO
    unless  -  evaluate forms unless a condition is true

    USAGE
    unless test {form}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the values of the last FORM, if the result of evaluating TEST is
    false,  otherwise returns nil.  If the TEST is false, then the FORMS are
    evaluated sequentially as if in a progn.

    The following identities hold:

    (unless test a b c) = (cond ((not test) a b c))
    (unless test a b c) = (if test nil (progn a b c))
    (unless test a b c) = (when (not test) a b c)

    EXAMPLES
    (setf x 16)
    (unless (minusp x) (sqrt x)) => 4.0s0
    (unless (plusp x) (setq x "negative number")) => nil
    x => 16
