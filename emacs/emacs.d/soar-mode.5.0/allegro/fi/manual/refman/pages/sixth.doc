    FUNCTION
    sixth  -  get the sixth element of a list

    USAGE
    sixth list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the sixth element of LIST, where the car of LIST  is  considered
    to be the first element.  LIST must be a list.

    Unlike the nth function, which uses zero-origin indexing, this  function
    uses  one-origin indexing.  If the list has fewer than six elements, nil
    is returned.  setf may be used with sixth to replace the  sixth  element
    of a list.

    EXAMPLES
    (sixth '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => f
    (sixth '(a)) => nil
    (setq lis '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => (a b c d e f g h i j)
    (setf (sixth lis) 6) => 6
    lis => (a b c d e 6 g h i j)
