    FUNCTION
    logandc2  -  bitwise logical `and', complementing the second argument

    USAGE
    logandc2 n1 n2

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `and' of N1 and the complement of  N2,  both
    of  which must be integers.  Arguments and results are interpreted as if
    represented in two's-complement notation.  The following identity holds:

    (logandc2 x y) = (logand x (lognot y))

    EXAMPLES
    (logandc2 -1 5) => -6

    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (The printer drops leading zeros when printing integers.
    ;;  The printed number #b100 is equivalent to #b0100.)
    (logandc2 #b1100 #b1010) => #b100
