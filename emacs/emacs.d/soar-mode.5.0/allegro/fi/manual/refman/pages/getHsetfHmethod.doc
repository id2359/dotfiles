    FUNCTION
    get-setf-method  -  get the setf method for a form

    USAGE
    get-setf-method form

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the five values that make up the setf  method  for  FORM,  which
    must  be  a generalized variable reference.  The roles played by each of
    the five values are described briefly below.

    The first two of the five values are a list of temporary variables and a
    list  of forms to bind to those temporary variables.  The third returned
    value is a list with one element,  the  single  variable  that  will  be
    stored  into  the  generalized  variable. The fourth value is called the
    STORING FORM and is code that will be used to store the new value in the
    generalized  variable. This code may refer to any of the temporary vari-
    ables.  The fifth value is called the ACCESSING  FORM  and  returns  the
    value of the generalized variable.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We define a function TAIL and a setf-method for it.
    ;;  Then, GET-SETF-METHOD returns five values corresponding
    ;;  to what we defined.
    (defun tail (lis)
      (cdr lis))

    (define-setf-method tail (lis)
      (let* ((temp-var (gensym))            ; temp var for list
             (store-var (gensym)))          ; temp var for new tail
        (values
         (list temp-var)                    ; temporary variables
         (list lis)                         ; value forms
         (list store-var)                   ; store variables
         `(progn
            (rplacd ,temp-var ,store-var)
            ,store-var)                     ; storing form
         `(cdr ,temp-var))))                ; accessing form

    (tail my-list) => (b c)
    (setf (tail my-list) '(x y z)) => (x y z)
