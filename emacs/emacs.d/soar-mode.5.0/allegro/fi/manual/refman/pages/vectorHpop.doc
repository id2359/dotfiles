    FUNCTION
    vector-pop  -  decrease the fill pointer of a vector by one

    USAGE
    vector-pop vector

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The value of the fill pointer of VECTOR is decreased by one,  unless  it
    is already zero.

    DESCRIPTION
    Decrements the file pointer of VECTOR by one, then returns  the  element
    indexed  by  the  new  file  pointer.   This element is no longer in the
    active part of VECTOR, but is the formerly last active element.   It  is
    an  error  if  VECTOR is not as vector with a fill pointer.  An error is
    signaled if the fill pointer is zero when this function is called.

    EXAMPLES
    (let* ((w (make-array '(3)
                          :initial-contents  '(a b c)
                          :fill-pointer t ))
           (former-fill-pointer (fill-pointer w)))
      (vector-pop w)
      (values former-fill-pointer w (fill-pointer w)))
       => 3 #(a b) 2
