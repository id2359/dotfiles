    FUNCTION
    yes-or-no-p  -  ask the user a yes-or-no question

    Usage
    yes-or-no-p [FORMAT-STRING {ARGS}*]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The  question is output to the value of *query-io*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns non-nil if the user's response is affirmative  and  nil  if  the
    response  is  negative.   If  FORMAT-STRING  is  supplied,  the function
    fresh-line is called and the format string is displayed  as  if  it  and
    ARGS  were given to the function format. Whether or not FORMAT-STRING is
    supplied, a response is expected from the user. (The query may have been
    generated separately.)  The range of acceptable responses is implementa-
    tion dependent.  However, the acceptable responses should  all  necessi-
    tate entering more than a single character.

    FORMAT-STRING must be a string.  It may  include  format  directives  as
    specified for the format function.  If any of the format directives take
    arguments the arguments are taken sequentially from ARGS.  FORMAT-STRING
    should be a query that can take an affirmative or negative response. For
    portability, the  query  itself  should  not  say  what  are  acceptable
    responses, since they are implementation-dependent.  Implementations may
    provide information about acceptable  responses  when  the  function  is
    evaluated.   (For  example, the acceptable responses may be given if the
    first response is inappropriate.)

    If the possible consequences of the user's response are neither  serious
    nor difficult to rectify, the function y-or-n-p, which has the same syn-
    tax but can be responded to more easily, can be used.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The specific message as well as the details of the
    ;;  script (the prompt, etc.) are implementation-dependent.
    <cl> (PROGN (SETF (GET 'FRED 'STATUS) 'HIRED)
           (IF (YES-OR-NO-P "REALLY WANT TO FIRE FRED? ")
               (SETF (GET 'FRED 'STATUS) 'FIRED)))
    Really want to fire fred? I GUESS SO
    Type "yes" for yes or "no" for no.
    Really want to fire fred? YES
    fired
