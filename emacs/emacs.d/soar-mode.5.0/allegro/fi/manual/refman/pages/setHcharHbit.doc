    FUNCTION
    set-char-bit  -  return a character with a specific control bit set or
      clear

    USAGE
    set-char-bit char bit flag

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a character that is the same as CHAR, except that the named  BIT
    will be set if FLAG is non-nil, or cleared if FLAG is nil.

    The behavior of this function is implementation-dependent since  on  the
    one hand, implementations are not required to support the bits attribute
    of characters and, on the other  hand,   may  support  more  than  four.
    Further,  an  implementation  may  choose  different names for supported
    bits.  The customary names for character bits of weights 1, 2, 4, and  8
    are :control, :meta, :super, and :hyper, respectively.  If the named bit
    is supported, this function works as described.  If it is not supported,
    the  behavior  is  not  specified,  but the bit will not be set and most
    likely an error will be signalled.

    As an alternative to this function, one may use setf with char-bit, sub-
    ject  to  the same restrictions, noting that the character object stored
    in the argument to char-bit will be modified.

    EXAMPLES
    (set-char-bit #\A :control t) => #\control-\A
    (set-char-bit #\Control-\A :control nil) => #\A
    (set-char-bit #\Control-\x :meta t) => #\control-meta-\x
    (set-char-bit #\Meta-\x :meta t) => #\meta-\x
