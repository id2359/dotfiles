    See the manual page about declarations for a discussion of the scope  of
    declarations.

    Each DECL-SPEC is not evaluated, and must be a valid declaration specif-
    ier. A declaration specifier is a list whose car is its name.  For exam-
    ple, (inline FOO) is a declaration specifier that advises  the  compiler
    to compile calls to the function FOO inline.  All declaration specifiers
    are advisory, except special, which alters the default  scoping  proper-
    ties of a variable.

    EXAMPLES
    (defun careful (x y)
      (declare (integer x) (float y) (optimize safety))
      (+ x y)) => careful
