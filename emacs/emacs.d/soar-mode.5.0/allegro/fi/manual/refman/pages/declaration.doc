    DECLARATION SPECIFIER
    declaration  -  advise compiler about non-standard declaration names

    USAGE
    declaration {name}*

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The COMMON LISP system is advised that each NAME is a  declaration  name
    that is not standard, but valid nonetheless.

    DESCRIPTION
    The purpose of a declaration is to advise the system about the code con-
    taining  the  declaration.   declaration allows you to name declarations
    other than those provided  by  COMMON  LISP  (or  your  implementation).
    These  declarations  will not affect a version of COMMON LISP which does
    not recognize them, but it will prevent  errors  from  being  signalled.
    Its  purpose  is  to  allow the same code to be used with different com-
    pilers  without  unnecessary  errors  and  warnings.   This  declaration
    specifier may be used only in proclamations.

    EXAMPLES
    (proclaim '(declaration target-machine)) => t
    (proclaim '(target-machine PDP-11)) => t
