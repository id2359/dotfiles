    FUNCTION
    write-byte  -  write a `byte' to a stream

    Usage
    write-byte INTEGER STREAM

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The byte is output to the stream.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns INTEGER, which is the integer whose value is written as  a  byte
    to  STREAM.   The  argument  STREAM  must be a binary stream, that is, a
    stream whose element type is a finite subtype of integer.  The  type  of
    INTEGER must be of the same type as the stream-element type.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq *print-base* 2)
    (with-open-file (out "junk"
                         :direction :output
                         :if-exists :supersede
                         :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))
      (with-open-file (in "junk"
                          :direction :input
                          :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))
        (write-byte #b10010101 out)
        (finish-output out)
        (read-byte in))) => 10010101
