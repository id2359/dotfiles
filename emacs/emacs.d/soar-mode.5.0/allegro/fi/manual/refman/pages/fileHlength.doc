    FUNCTION
    file-length  -  return the size of an open file

    USAGE
    file-length file-stream

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a non-negative integer  representing  the  length  of  the  file
    FILE-STREAM  if  that  information is available, and nil otherwise.  The
    argument FILE-STREAM must be a stream open  to  a  file.   The  returned
    length  for  binary files is measured in units of the kind of data being
    transferred.  (Binary files are those files opened with :element-type  a
    subtype of integer.) See open and :element-type.

    EXAMPLES
    (with-open-file (out "junk" :direction :output
                         :if-exists :supersede)
      (format out "~A ~A" 'foo 'bar)) => nil
    (with-open-file (in "junk" :direction :input)
      (file-length in)) => 7
