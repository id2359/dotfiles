    FUNCTION
    decode-float  -  access internal representation of a floating-point
      number

    USAGE
    decode-float float

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns three values: SIGNIFICAND, EXPONENT, and SIGN.  These values are
    computed  as follows.  Let R be the radix of the internal floating-point
    representation.  The SIGNIFICAND and the EXPONENT are computed by  find-
    ing the integer exponent to R so that the quotient of FLOAT and R raised
    to that exponent is between 1/R (inclusive)  and  1  (exclusive).   Then
    EXPONENT,   the   second  value  returned,  is  the  exponent  used  and
    SIGNIFICAND, the first value returned, is the quotient of  FLOAT  and  R
    raised  to  EXPONENT.  SIGN, the third value returned, has the same sign
    and format as FLOAT and has absolute value 1.

    FLOAT must be a real, floating-point number. SIGNIFICAND and  SIGN  have
    the  same  format  as FLOAT.  EXPONENT is an integer.  If FLOAT is zero,
    EXPONENT may be  any  integer  (depending  on  the  implementation)  and
    SIGNIFICAND will be positive zero, again in the same format as FLOAT.

    EXAMPLES
    (decode-float 8.0) => 0.5 4 1.0
    (decode-float -8.0) => 0.5 4 -1.0
    (decode-float 0.125d0) => 0.5d0 -2 1.0d0
