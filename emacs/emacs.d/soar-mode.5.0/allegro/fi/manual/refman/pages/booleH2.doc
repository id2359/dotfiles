    CONSTANT
    boole-2  -  specify bitwise logical operation to return operand two

    DESCRIPTION
    Used as the first argument to  boole  to  specify  the  bitwise  boolean
    operation that returns its second operand (the third argument to boole).

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  The result is always the second operand.
    (boole boole-2 #b1100 #b1010) => #b1010
