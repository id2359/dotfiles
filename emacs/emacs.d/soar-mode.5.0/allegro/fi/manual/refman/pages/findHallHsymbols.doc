    FUNCTION
    find-all-symbols  -  find all symbols in the entire Lisp system with a
      specified print name

    USAGE
    find-all-symbols name

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a list of symbols whose print  names  match  that  specified  by
    NAME.   The argument NAME must be a string or a symbol.  If it is a sym-
    bol, its print name is used as the string.  (Note that if  the  argument
    is  a  symbol  that  does  not  exist in the current package, it will be
    created by the reader and returned as part of the list.)  Every  package
    in  the  entire  Lisp system is searched.  Any symbol SYM satisfying the
    following test is returned.

    (string= (symbol-name sym) (string name))

    EXAMPLES
    (find-all-symbols "FOO") => nil
    (find-all-symbols :foo) => (:foo)
    (find-all-symbols 'foo) => (foo :foo)
    (find-all-symbols "FOO") => (foo :foo)

    (find-all-symbols :equal) => (equal :equal)
