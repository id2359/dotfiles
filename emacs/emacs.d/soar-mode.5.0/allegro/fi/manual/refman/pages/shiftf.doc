    MACRO
    shiftf  -  shift a new value in from the right (destructive)

    USAGE
    shiftf {place}+ newval

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The values in the locations specified by the generalized-variable refer-
    ences PLACE are destructively modified.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the original value of the first PLACE, but this  macro  is  used
    for  its  side effects.  The value of each generalized variable PLACE is
    first determined and saved.  The form NEWVAL is then evaluated  and  its
    value saved.  Then, the value of each PLACE, beginning with the leftmost
    PLACE and proceeding to the right, is replaced by the saved value of the
    PLACE immediately to its right.  The value of the last PLACE is replaced
    by the saved value of NEWVAL.  The original value of the leftmost  PLACE
    is  returned  by  shiftf.  Note that any subforms of each PLACE form are
    evaluated only once.  The PLACES can be thought of as  forming  a  shift
    register, with NEWVAL being shifted in from the right.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x 1 y 2 z 3) => 3
    (shiftf x y z 4) => 1
    x => 2
    y => 3
    z => 4

    (setq lis '(a b c)) => (a b c)
    (shiftf (car lis) (cadr lis)) => a
    lis => (b b c)
