    VARIABLE
    *features*  -  bound to the list of symbols identifying the features
      available in your implementation

    Usage
    *features*

    DESCRIPTION
    The value of this special variable is  a  list  of  symbols  identifying
    features of the implementation.

    The exact type of symbols used is  implementation-dependent.   A  common
    choice  (illustrated  in  the examples) is to name a feature with a key-
    word.

    The reader macros #+ and #- use the value of this variable.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following example is implementation-  and version-dependent:
    (push :cox *features*)
    (quote (#+:cox charley #-:cox fred)) => (charley)
