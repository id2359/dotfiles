    FUNCTION
    symbol-function  -  get the global function definition of a symbol

    USAGE
    symbol-function symbol

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the global function definition associated with SYMBOL.   If  the
    SYMBOL  has  no  global  function  definition,  this function signals an
    error.  (It is generally recommended that fboundp be used before  apply-
    ing symbol-function.)

    The value returned may be a function or  an  object  that  represents  a
    macro definition or a special form.  (Macros and special forms cannot be
    applied using apply or funcall.)

    Only the global function definition of a symbol  is  accessible.   Local
    definitions  associated  with  SYMBOL are not visible.  One may use setf
    with symbol-function to replace the current global  function  definition
    of symbol.  (There can only be one global function definition, which may
    be a macro or a function.)

    EXAMPLES
    (defun foo (x) (car x))
    (symbol-function 'foo) => (lambda (x) (block foo (car x)))
    (setf (symbol-function 'foo) '(lambda (x)(cadr x)))
    (symbol-function 'foo) => (lambda (x) (cadr x))
    (flet ((foo (x y) (cons x y)))
      (symbol-function 'foo)) => (lambda (x) (cadr x))
