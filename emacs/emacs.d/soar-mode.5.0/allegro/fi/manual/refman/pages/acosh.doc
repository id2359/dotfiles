    FUNCTION
    acosh  -  get the hyperbolic arc cosine of a number

    USAGE
    acosh number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the hyperbolic arc cosine of NUMBER, that is,  the  value  whose
    hyperbolic  cosine  is  NUMBER.   The result is complex when NUMBER is a
    real number less than 1.

    The branch cut for acosh lies along the real axis, extending from  1  to
    negative  infinity.   From  1 to 0 the branch cut is continuous with the
    first quadrant, while from 0 to negative infinity it is continuous  with
    the  second quadrant.  The range consists of points in the complex plane
    whose real part is non-negative and whose imaginary part takes on values
    from  -J  (exclusive) to J (inclusive).  If the real part of a number is
    zero then it is in the range if  its  imaginary  part  is  between  zero
    (inclusive) and J (inclusive).

    EXAMPLES
    (acosh 2) => 1.316958
    (acosh 1) => 0.0
    (acosh 0.5) => #c(0.0 1.0471976)
