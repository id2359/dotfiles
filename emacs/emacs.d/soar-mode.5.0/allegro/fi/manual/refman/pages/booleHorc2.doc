    CONSTANT
    boole-orc2  -  specify bitwise logical `or' operation, complementing
      operand two

    DESCRIPTION
    Used as the first argument to boole to specify the bitwise boolean  `or'
    operation  that  complements  its  second operand (the third argument to
    boole).

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (Since bitwise logical operations interpret integers as
    ;;  half-infinite, the result is negative, which in two's-
    ;;  complement representation has an infinite string of 1's
    ;;  to the right, that is toward higher-order bits.  The
    ;;  number #b-11 would be represented in two's-complement
    ;;  as ...1111101.)
    (boole boole-orc2 #b1100 #b1010) => #b-11
    (ldb (byte 4 0) #b-11) => #b1101
    (logbitp 100 #b-11) => t
