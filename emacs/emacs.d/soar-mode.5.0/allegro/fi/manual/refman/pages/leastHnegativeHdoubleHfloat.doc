    CONSTANT
    least-negative-double-float  -  negative double-float closest to zero

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the value of the negative double-float number  nearest  to  (but
    still  different from) zero.  This value is implementation-dependent but
    is guaranteed not to be minus zero (if the implementation  has  distinct
    signed floating-point zeroes).

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  This value is implementation-dependent.
    least-negative-double-float => -2.2250738585072027d-308
