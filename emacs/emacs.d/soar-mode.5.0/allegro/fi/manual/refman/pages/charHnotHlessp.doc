    FUNCTION
    char-not-lessp  -  test whether given characters are monotonically
      nonincreasing, ignoring case and bits

    USAGE
    char-not-lessp {char}+

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if each CHAR is greater than or equal to the next  argument
    CHAR  specified  and returns nil otherwise.  char-not-lessp ignores case
    and any bits attributes and takes font attributes  into  account  in  an
    implementation-dependent  way.   Each  CHAR  must be a character object.
    The ordering on characters obeys alphabetic ordering within letters, and
    numeric  ordering  within the digits 0 through 9.  Digits are not inter-
    leaved with letters, but whether a digit is less than or greater than  a
    letter  depends  on  the  implementation.   The  function char>= is like
    char-not-lessp except that it also checks case, and bits and font attri-
    butes.

    EXAMPLES
    (char-not-lessp #\b #\b) => t
    (char-not-lessp #\d #\c) => t
    (char-not-lessp #\c #\d) => nil
    (char-not-lessp #\b #\B) => t
    (char-not-lessp #\B #\b) => t
    (char-not-lessp #\b) => t

    ;;  The following result is implementation-dependent:
    (char-not-lessp #\b #\1) => t
