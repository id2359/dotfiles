    FUNCTION
    bit-eqv  -  perform a bitwise logical `equivalence' on two bit arrays

    USAGE
    bit-eqv bit-array1 bit-array2 [result-array]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    If RESULT-ARRAY is provided as  an  argument,  then  it  will  hold  the
    results  of  the  logical  operation and thus be modified.  RESULT-ARRAY
    must be a bit array of the same rank and dimensions  as  the  other  two
    arguments.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `equivalence' of BIT-ARRAY1 and  BIT-ARRAY2,
    which  must  both  be  bit  arrays of the same rank and dimensions.  The
    result is produced by performing the operation on corresponding elements
    of  the  two  arrays.  If the optional argument RESULT-ARRAY is not pro-
    vided,  a  new  bit  array  is  created  and  returned.    The   logical
    `equivalence' of two bits is 1 if and only if both bits are identical.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  #* is the reader macro for bit vectors.
    (setq bit-arr (make-array 4 :element-type 'bit))
    (bit-eqv #*1100 #*1010 bit-arr) => #*1001
    bit-arr => #*1001
