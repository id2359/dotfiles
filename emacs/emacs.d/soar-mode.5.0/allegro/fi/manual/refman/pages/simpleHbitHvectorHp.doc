    FUNCTION
    simple-bit-vector-p  -  test whether an object is a simple bit-vector

    USAGE
    simple-bit-vector-p object

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if OBJECT is a simple bit vector, and false  otherwise.   A
    simple  bit  vector  has  no  fill  pointer, is not displaced to another
    array, and is not adjustable.  The following identity holds:

    (simple-bit-vector-p x) = (typep x 'simple-bit-vector)

    EXAMPLES
    (simple-bit-vector-p #*0101) => t
