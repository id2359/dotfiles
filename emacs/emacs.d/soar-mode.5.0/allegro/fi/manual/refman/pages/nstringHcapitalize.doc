    FUNCTION
    nstring-capitalize  -  capitalize words in a string (destructive)

    USAGE
    nstring-capitalize string [:start sn] [:end en]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The argument STRING is changed.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns STRING, after modifying it as string-capitalize would given  the
    same  arguments.   The effect on STRING is that every letter is replaced
    (if necessary) with its lowercase equivalent except for the first letter
    of  each  word,  which  is  replaced  (if  necessary) with its uppercase
    equivalent.  These case conversions  are  done  provided  the  candidate
    characters are case-modifiable.

    In this context, a word is defined to be  a  substring  of  alphanumeric
    characters delimited at either end by a nonalphanumeric or by the begin-
    ning or the end of STRING.  Note that  this  convention  may  result  in
    letters being capitalized that would not ordinarily be capitalized.  See
    below.

    To operate on a substring of STRING, specify values for the  :start  and
    :end  keyword  arguments.  The :start keyword indicates the index of the
    first character of the substring to modify.  Its value defaults to  zero
    (the  first  character  of STRING).  The :end keyword specifies an index
    one greater than the index of the last character to examine. A value  of
    nil is equivalent to the default, the length of the string.

    The length of the returned string is the same as the  length  of  STRING
    regardless  of  the  values of SN and EN.  The argument STRING must be a
    string.  It cannot be a symbol.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq s "panIC")
    (nstring-capitalize s) => "Panic"
    s => "Panic"
    (nstring-capitalize "Are you SURE it's man-made?")
      => "Are You Sure It'S Man-Made?"
    ;; Note: the capital S in it'S is correct.
    (nstring-capitalize "Are you SURE it's man-made?"
      :start 8 :end 17) => "Are you Sure It'S man-made?"
