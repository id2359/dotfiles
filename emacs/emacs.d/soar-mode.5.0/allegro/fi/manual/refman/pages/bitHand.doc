    FUNCTION
    bit-and  -  perform a bitwise logical `and' on two bit arrays

    USAGE
    bit-and bit-array1 bit-array2 [result-array]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    If RESULT-ARRAY is provided as  an  argument,  then  it  will  hold  the
    results  of  the  logical  operation and thus be modified.  RESULT-ARRAY
    must be a bit array of the same rank and dimensions  as  the  other  two
    arguments.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `and' of BIT-ARRAY1  and  BIT-ARRAY2,  which
    must  both be bit arrays of the same rank and dimensions.  The result is
    produced by performing the operation on corresponding  elements  of  the
    two arrays.  If the optional argument RESULT-ARRAY is not provided, then
    a new bit array is created and returned.  The logical `and' of two  bits
    is 1 if and only if both bits are 1.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  #* is the reader macro for bit vectors.
    (setq bit-arr (make-array 4 :element-type 'bit))
    (bit-and #*1100 #*1010 bit-arr) => #*1000
    bit-arr => #*1000
