    FUNCTION
    subtypep  -  test whether one type is subtype of another

    USAGE
    subtypep type2 type2

    DESCRIPTION
    This function attempts to determine the relationship between two  types.
    Two  values  are returned.  If TYPE1 is definitely a subtype of TYPE2, t
    and t are returned.  If TYPE1 is definitely NOT a subtype of TYPE2,  nil
    and  t  are returned.  If the relationship cannot be determined, nil and
    nil are returned.  The second value value indicates the certainty of the
    first value returned.

    EXAMPLES
    (subtypep 'integer 'number) => t t
    (subtypep 'integer 'integer) => t t
    (subtypep 'integer 'float) => nil t
    (subtypep '(satisfies plusp) '(satisfies oddp)) => nil nil
