    FUNCTION
    directory-namestring  -  get a representation of the directory part of a
      pathname

    USAGE
    directory-namestring pathname

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a string representing the directory part of PATHNAME, which must
    be  a  pathname, string, symbol, or stream.  If PATHNAME is a stream, it
    must be associated with a file.  Note that it  may  not  necessarily  be
    possible  to  construct  a  valid namestring by concatenating the values
    returned by host-namestring, directory-namestring,  and  file-namestring
    on a given pathname.

    EXAMPLES
    ;; This example is hypothetical.
    (directory-namestring
     (make-pathname :host "franz"
                    :directory "[cl.v030]"
                    :name "cl"
                    :type "exe"))
      => "[cl.v030]/"
