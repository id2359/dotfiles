    FUNCTION
    print  -  output a newline, a printed representation of an object such
      that it can be read back, and a space in that order

    Usage
    print OBJECT [STREAM]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A newline, the printed representation of OBJECT, and a space are written
    to STREAM.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns OBJECT, but this function is used for its  side  effects.   This
    function  outputs  to  STREAM characters that represent OBJECT.  This is
    usually done in such a way that the object may be read back  with  read.
    It  effectively  binds  *print-escape* to true while printing OBJECT.  A
    newline is output before the representation of OBJECT, and  a  space  is
    output after it.

    The argument STREAM may be a stream that accepts output, or  STREAM  may
    be  t nil.  If STREAM is nil, output goes to *standard-output*, which is
    also the default value if STREAM is not specified.  If STREAM is t, out-
    put goes to *terminal-io*.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Note the new line before the printed output.
    (print "this is a test") => "this is a test"
      PRINTS
    "this is a test"
    (prin1 "this is a test") => "this is a test"
      PRINTS "this is a test"
    (princ "this is a test") => "this is a test"
      PRINTS this is a test
