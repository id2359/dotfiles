    SPECIAL FORM
    multiple-value-prog1  -  evaluate forms sequentially, returning all of
      the values returned by the first form

    USAGE
    multiple-value-prog1 {form}+

    DESCRIPTION
    All the forms provided as arguments  are  evaluated  sequentially.   All
    values   returned   by   the  first  form  are  saved  and  returned  by
    multiple-value-prog1.  multiple-value-prog1 differs from prog1  in  that
    prog1  returns  exactly one value, the first value returned by the first
    form or nil, if the first form returns no values.   multiple-value-prog1
    returns  exactly what the first form returns, whether zero, one, or mul-
    tiple values.  At least one form must be provided as an argument.

    Like prog1, multiple-value-prog1 is usually used to get  the  values  of
    the first form before the side effects of the later forms take effect.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq num 10) => 10
    (multiple-value-prog1
        (floor num 3))
      (incf num))) => 3 1
    num => 11
