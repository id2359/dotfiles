    FUNCTION
    logior  -  bitwise logical `inclusive or'

    USAGE
    logior {n}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `inclusive or'  of  its  arguments,  all  of
    which  must  be integers.  If no arguments are specified, 0 is returned.
    0 is the identity for this function.  Arguments and results  are  inter-
    preted as if represented in two's-complement notation.

    EXAMPLES
    (logior) => 0
    (logior 1) => 1
    (logior 1 3) => 3

    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    (boole boole-ior #b1100 #b1010) => #b1110
