    FUNCTION
    logcount  -  count number of 1 or 0 bits in an integer.

    USAGE
    logcount n

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a non-negative integer giving the number bits in N that are 1 if
    N  is  non-negative  and the number of bits that are 0 if N is negative.
    The argument  N,  which  must  be  an  integer,  is  interpreted  as  if
    represented  in  two's-complement  notation.   The  following identities
    hold:

    (logcount x) = (logcount (- (+ x 1)))
                 = (logcount (lognot x))

    EXAMPLES
    (logcount 2) => 1
    (logcount 7) => 3
    (logcount -7) => 2
    (logcount #b01011) => 3
