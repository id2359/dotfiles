    FUNCTION
    name-char  -  get a character given its name

    USAGE
    name-char name

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the character represented by NAME if there is one, and nil  oth-
    erwise.   NAME  must  be  a string or an object that can be coerced to a
    string with the function string.  This string is compared  to  character
    names  using  the  case-insensitive  comparison  function  string-equal.
    Characters with names include #\Newline and #\Space (which are  standard
    characters  available in every implementation), #\Tab, #\Page, #\Rubout,
    #\Linefeed, and #\Backspace (which are semistandard  characters  usually
    available).   There may be other named characters in a particular imple-
    mentation.  Characters that always have names are those for which  there
    is  no  simple  graphic representation or glyph and which have zero font
    and bits attributes.

    Whether the name of an alphanumeric character is the  string  containing
    the  character  depends  on  the implementation.  In the example below A
    does not name #\A.

    EXAMPLES
    (name-char "space") => #\space
    (name-char 'Newline) => #\newline

    ;;  The tab character may not be supported:
    (name-char "tAb") => #\tab

    ;;  Some implementations may return #\A for the next form:
    (name-char "A") => nil
