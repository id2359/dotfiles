    FUNCTION
    rplacd  -  replace the cdr of a list (destructive)

    USAGE
    rplacd x y

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The argument X is changed.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the argument X, which must be a cons, after first replacing  its
    cdr  with  the arbitrary object Y.  Use this function with caution since
    when it is applied to lists which share storage with other lists,  unex-
    pected results can occur.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq c '(w x y z)) => (w x y z)
    (rplacd (cdr c) '(u v)) => (x u v)
    c => (w x u v)
    (rplacd (cdr c) 'm) => (x . m)
    c => (w x . m)
