    FUNCTION
    asin  -  get the arc sine of a number

    USAGE
    asin number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the arc sine of NUMBER; that is, a number in radians whose  sine
    is  NUMBER.   The argument may be of any number type, including complex.
    The result may be complex, as in cases when the absolute value of NUMBER
    is greater than 1.

    There are two portions to the branch cut for asin.  One lies  along  the
    negative  real axis from -1 (inclusive) to negative infinity, continuous
    with the second quadrant, and the other lies  along  the  positive  real
    axis from 1 (inclusive) to positive infinity, continuous with the fourth
    quadrant.  The range consists of points in the complex plane whose  real
    part  is  between -J/2 (including the end point if the imaginary part is
    non-negative), and J/2 (including the end point if the imaginary part is
    nonpositive).

    EXAMPLES
    (asin 1/2) => 0.5235988
    (asin 0) => 0.0
    (asin 3) => #c(1.5707964 -1.7627472)
    (asin .8) => 0.92729527
