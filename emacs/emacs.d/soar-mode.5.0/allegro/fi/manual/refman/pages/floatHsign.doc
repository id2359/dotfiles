    FUNCTION
    float-sign  -  get the sign of a floating-point number

    USAGE
    float-sign float [other-float]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a floating-point number of the same sign and  format  as  FLOAT,
    and  of  the  same  absolute  value  as  OTHER-FLOAT.   If  the argument
    OTHER-FLOAT is not given, then it is assumed to be (float 1 FLOAT).  The
    returned  value  distinguishes between positive and negative zero if the
    implementation has distinct representations for these zeroes.

    EXAMPLES
    (float-sign -5.0 2.0) =>  -2.0
    (float-sign -6.0 2.0d0) => -2.0d0
    (float-sign -6.0) => -1.0
    (float-sign 0.0) => 1.0
