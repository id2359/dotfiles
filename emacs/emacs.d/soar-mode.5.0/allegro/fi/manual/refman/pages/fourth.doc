    FUNCTION
    fourth  -  get the fourth element of a list

    USAGE
    fourth list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the fourth element of LIST, where the car of LIST is  considered
    to be the first element.  LIST must be a list.

    Unlike the nth function, which uses zero-origin indexing, this  function
    uses one-origin indexing.  If the list has fewer than four elements, nil
    is returned.  setf may be used with fourth to replace the fourth element
    of a list.

    EXAMPLES
    (fourth '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => d
    (fourth '(a)) => nil
    (setq lis '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => (a b c d e f g h i j)
    (setf (fourth lis) 4) => 4
    lis => (a b c 4 e f g h i j)
