    Type SPECIFIER
    rational  -  the data type comprising exact rational numbers

    Usage
    {rational | (rational [{LOW | (LOW)} [{HIGH | (HIGH)}]])}

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a data type consisting of rational  numbers  between  LOW  and
    HIGH.   Either  limit is considered exclusive if it appears in a list by
    itself, otherwise it is considered  inclusive.   The  limits  should  be
    specified  as rationals or must be explicitly unspecified using *.  Fre-
    quently, implementations are less restrictive in the numeric  format  of
    the limits.

    ratio and integer are mutually  exclusive  subtypes  of  rational.   The
    canonical  representation  of a rational number in LISP is an integer if
    the value is integral, and otherwise a ratio reduced  to  simplest  form
    with a positive denominator.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x '(#B111/10 #O10/3 #9R10/3 3/30))
      => (7/2 8/3 3 1/10)
    (mapcar #'type-of x) => (ratio ratio fixnum ratio)
    (typep 4/5 '(rational 0 1)) => t
    (subtypep 'integer 'rational) => t t
