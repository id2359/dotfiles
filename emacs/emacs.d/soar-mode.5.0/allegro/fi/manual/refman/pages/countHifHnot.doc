    FUNCTION
    count-if-not  -  count the elements in a sequence which fail a test

    Usage
     count-if-not TEST SEQUENCE [:start SN] [:end EN] [:key KEYFNC] [:from-
      end FE]

    DESCRIPTION

    Returns the number of items in the sequence SEQUENCE  which  fail  TEST.
    The argument TEST must be a function that accepts one argument.  An ele-
    ment fails the test if applying TEST to it returns false.

    If the keyword argument :key is specified and its value  KEYFNC  is  not
    nil,  KEYFNC  must  be a function that accepts one argument.  It will be
    applied to each element of SEQUENCE before that element is tested.  When
    unspecified or nil, it effectively defaults to the function identity.

    If the :from-end keyword argument is specified non-nil, SEQUENCE is pro-
    cessed  in  the reverse direction.  Doing so has no effect on the result
    of this function since counting  produces  the  same  result  in  either
    direction.  The argument is included for consistency with other sequence
    functions.

    To operate on a subsequence of SEQUENCE, specify  the  :start  and  :end
    keyword  arguments.   The :start keyword argument indicates the index of
    the first element of the subsequence to examine.  Its value defaults  to
    zero  (indicating  the first element).  The :end keyword argument speci-
    fies an index one greater than the index of the last element to examine.
    A value of nil is equivalent to the default, the length of the sequence.
    If SEQUENCE is a vector with a fill pointer, only the active elements of
    SEQUENCE can be examined.

    EXAMPLES
    (count-if-not #'characterp '(1 2 a b 4 d)) => 6
    (count-if-not #'characterp '(#\a #\b #\c d e)) => 2
    (count-if-not #'oddp '(1 2 7 9 11 31 7 8 53 11)
                  :start 3 :end 7) => 0
    (count-if-not  #'oddp '((1 2 3)(2 3 4)(3 4 5)) :key #'second) => 2
