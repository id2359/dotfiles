    FUNCTION
    ffloor  -  truncate a number toward negative infinity and convert the
      result to a floating-point number

    USAGE
    ffloor number [divisor]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns two values, Q and R.  Q is the result of truncating the quotient
    of  NUMBER and DIVISOR towards negative infinity, coerced to a float.  R
    is the difference between NUMBER and Q times DIVISOR.  That is,

    r = NUMBER - q*DIVISOR

    The result of truncating a number toward negative infinity is the  larg-
    est integer less than or equal to the number.

    If DIVISOR is not specified, it defaults to 1.  In that case, the  floor
    of NUMBER is returned as the first value.

    The format of the first returned value is a float with the  same  format
    as  NUMBER  (a single-float if NUMBER is rational).  The second returned
    value follows the rules of floating-point contagion (applied before Q is
    converted to a float).  Therefore, the second value may be an integer if
    both of the arguments are integers.

    NUMBER and DIVISOR must both be real numbers, either integer,  rational,
    or floating-point.

    EXAMPLES
    (ffloor 5.3) => 5.0 0.3
    (ffloor 3.5d0) => 3.0d0 0.5d0
    (ffloor 5 2) => 2.0 1
    (ffloor 5 -2) => -3.0 -1
    (ffloor -5 2) => -3.0 1
    (ffloor -5 -2) => 2.0 -1
    (ffloor -5.2 2) => -3.0 0.8
