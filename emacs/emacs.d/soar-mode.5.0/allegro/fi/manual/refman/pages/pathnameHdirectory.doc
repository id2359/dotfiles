    FUNCTION
    pathname-directory  -  get the directory component of a pathname

    USAGE
    pathname-directory path

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the directory component of PATH.  The directory is  one  of  the
    six  components  of  a  pathname (the other five are device, host, name,
    type, and version).  PATH must be a pathname, string, symbol, or stream.
    (If PATH is a stream, it must be, or have been, open to a file.)

    The directory component of a pathname is  implementation-dependent,  but
    may  be  either  nil  or  :wild.   nil  indicates  that the directory is
    unspecified; :wild is a directory component that `matches' any directory
    when  the pathname it appears in is used in a directory-search operation
    such as that performed by directory.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following example refers to a file on a VMS file system.
    (pathname-directory "pleiades::sys$sysdisk:[sys0.sysexe]lisp.exe;0")
      => ("SYS0" "SYSEXE")
