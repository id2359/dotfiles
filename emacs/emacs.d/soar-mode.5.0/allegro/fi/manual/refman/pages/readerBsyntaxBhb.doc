    READER SYNTAX
    #b  -  representation of a binary rational

    Usage
    #B...

    DESCRIPTION
    Reads as a rational number expressed in binary radix.

    When the reader reads the dispatch-macro  character  ``#''  followed  by
    ``b''  or  ``B'',  these  characters are discarded and the next token is
    read as the binary representation of a rational number.  The only  valid
    characters  in  such  a  representation are ``0'' and ``1''.  The ``#b''
    syntactic form reads as the rational number represented by the token.

    The ``#r'' syntactic form permits specification of  any  allowed  radix.
    Floating-point numbers are always read in decimal.

    Rational numbers are self-evaluating objects.  (In fact all numbers  are
    self-evaluating.)

    EXAMPLES
    #B1011 => 11
    #b001 => 1

    (setf *read-base* 20.)
    #b1011/10 => 11/2

    (setf *print-base* 2.)
    #b1011/11 => 1011/11
    10. => 1010
    10 => 10100
