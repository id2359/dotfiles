    FUNCTION
    copy-alist  -  copy first and second level structure of a list

    USAGE
    copy-alist list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a new list containing a copy  of  the  first-  and  second-level
    structure of LIST, which must be a cons or nil.  This means that succes-
    sive cdrs of LIST are copied, and each successive car of the new list is
    replaced by a copy if it is a cons.  As a result, corresponding elements
    of both lists are equal, though not in general  eq.   This  function  is
    often used to copy association lists.

    EXAMPLES
    (copy-alist '(a b . c)) => (a b . c)
    (setq x '((a) ((b)))) => ((a) ((b)))
    (setq y (copy-alist x)) => ((a) ((b)))
    (eq (car x) (car y)) => nil
    (eq (caadr x) (caadr y)) => t
