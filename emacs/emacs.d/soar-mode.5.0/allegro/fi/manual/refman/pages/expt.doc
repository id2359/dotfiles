    FUNCTION
    expt  -  raise a number to a power

    USAGE
    expt base power

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the result of raising BASE to POWER.  Rational numbers raised to
    integer  powers  will  give  back rationals.  If POWER is the value 0 of
    type integer, then the result will be 1 coerced to the type of BASE.  If
    POWER  is  the value of 0 in some other type, then the result is 1 after
    the application of the standard contagion rules.  (Note,  however,  that
    it  is an error to raise a non-integer 0 value for BASE to the 0 power.)
    Otherwise, an appropriate value will be returned, whether it be an exact
    number, a floating-point approximation, or perhaps a complex number.

    The range of the function expt is the entire complex plane.  As a  func-
    tion  of  the  argument POWER, there is no branch cut.  As a function of
    the argument BASE, the branch cut for expt is continuous with the second
    quadrant,  and  lies  on  the  negative  real axis.  The domain does not
    include the origin.

    EXAMPLES
    (expt 2 3) => 8
    (expt 8 1/3) => 2.0
    (expt -1 1/2) => #c(0.0 1.0)
