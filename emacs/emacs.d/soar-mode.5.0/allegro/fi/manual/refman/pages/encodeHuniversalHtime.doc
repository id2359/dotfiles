    FUNCTION
    encode-universal-time  -  convert decoded time to Universal time format

    Usage
    encode-universal-time SECOND MINUTE HOUR DATE MONTH YEAR [TIME-ZONE]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a non-negative integer representation in Universal  Time  format
    of the instant of time corresponding to that specified by the arguments,
    which are components of Decoded Time format.

    In Decoded Time format, the second and minute  components  are  integers
    from  0  to  59   inclusive,  the day is an integer from 1 to 31 but not
    greater than the number of days in the month, the month  is  an  integer
    from  1  to 12, and the year is either the full number of the Common Era
    (i.e. AD), such as 1948, or a two-digit number, which is interpreted  as
    the  year  with those last two digits within 50 years before (inclusive)
    and 50 years after (exclusive) of the current year.  Thus, in  1987,  37
    is  1937  and  36  is  2036, but in 1988, 37 is 2037 .  TIME-ZONE, which
    defaults  to  the  current  time  zone  on  your  machine  adjusted  for
    daylight-saving  time,  is  the  number  of time zones west of Greenwich
    (i.e. hours less than GMT).  If TIME-ZONE is  specified,  no  adjustment
    for daylight-saving time is done.

    Universal Time is the number of seconds since  midnight  of  January  1,
    1900  GMT.   Therefore,  relative Universal Time (the difference between
    two values in Universal Time format) is a number of seconds.  Every  day
    is  86400  seconds long, and leap years occur in every year divisible by
    four, except those divisible by 100 and not 400 (making 2000 a leap year
    but  1900  not a leap year).  Because Universal Time is represented as a
    non-negative integer, times before midnight of January 1, 1900  are  not
    representable.

    EXAMPLES
    (encode-universal-time 22 37 6 12 3 1984) => 2656939042
    ;;  6:37:22 am on March 12, 1984 in California.
