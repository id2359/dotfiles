    FUNCTION
    unread-char  -  push a character back onto the input stream

    Usage
    unread-char CHAR [STREAM]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The next character read from STREAM will be CHAR.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil, but this function is used for its side effects.  Successive
    calls  to  unread-char must be interspersed with calls to read-char, the
    consequence being that at most  one  character  may  be  unread  from  a
    stream.   The  argument STREAM may be a stream, nil, or t.  If STREAM is
    nil, the default, then the value of *standard-input* is  the  stream  to
    which  the  character  is  pushed  back.  If  STREAM  is t, the value of
    *terminal-io* is the stream.

    EXAMPLES
    <cl> (SETQ MY-STRING (MAKE-STRING-INPUT-STREAM "FRED"))
    #<string input stream  @ #x56e8d1>
    <cl> (READ-CHAR MY-STRING)
    #\f
    <cl> (READ MY-STRING)
    red
    <cl> (SETQ MY-STRING (MAKE-STRING-INPUT-STREAM "FRED"))
    #<string input stream  @ #x56ea59>
    <cl> (READ-CHAR MY-STRING)
    #\f
    <cl> (UNREAD-CHAR #\F MY-STRING)
    nil
    <cl> (READ MY-STRING).
