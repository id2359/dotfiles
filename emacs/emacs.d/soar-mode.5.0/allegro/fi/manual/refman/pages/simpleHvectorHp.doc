    FUNCTION
    simple-vector-p  -  test whether an object is a simple general vector

    USAGE
    simple-vector-p object

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if OBJECT is a simple general vector, and false otherwise.

    The type simple-vector is identical to the type  (simple-array  t  (*)),
    NOT  to  the  type (simple-array * (*)).  This is why the second example
    below is false, since a simple string (created by  the  reader  when  it
    encounters  a  sequence of characters delimited by #\") is a specialized
    array that holds string-char objects, not a general array holding  char-
    acters.   (All  COMMON LISP implementations are required to provide spe-
    cialized arrays for strings and bit vectors.)

    The following identities hold:

    simple-vector = (simple-array t (*))
    (simple-vector-p x) = (typep x 'simple-vector)

    EXAMPLES
    (simple-vector-p '#(a b c)) => t
    (simple-vector-p "a b c") => nil
