    VARIABLE
    *terminal-io*  -  user console stream

    USAGE
    *terminal-io*

    DESCRIPTION
    Bound to a stream that reads from the user's keyboard and writes to  the
    user's  display.   If you want to divert a stream that uses the console,
    you are encouraged not to change  the  *terminal-io*  variable,  but  to
    rebind one of the following synonym streams which are initially bound to
    *terminal-io*:  *standard-input*,   *standard-output*,   *error-output*,
    *debug-io*, *terminal-io*, and *trace-output*.

    EXAMPLES
    Evaluating the following code causes the integers 1 and 2 to be  written
    to a file and the integer 3 to be printed on the user's display.

    (with-open-file (*standard-output* "my-file"
                                       :if-exists :overwrite
                                       :if-does-not-exist :create
                                       :direction :output)
      (print 1)
      (print 2 *standard-output*)
      (print 3 *terminal-io*)
      'finished) => finished
