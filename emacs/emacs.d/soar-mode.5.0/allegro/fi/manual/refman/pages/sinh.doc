    FUNCTION
    sinh  -  get the hyperbolic sine of a number

    USAGE
    sinh number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the hyperbolic sine of NUMBER, which may be any number.  sinh is
    real for any real argument, but grows very quickly.

    The hyperbolic sine of a number x may be defined by the expression
    (/ (- (exp x) (exp (- x))) 2)

    EXAMPLES
    (sinh 0) => 0.0
    (sinh 1) => 1.1752012
    (sinh #c(1.0 2.0)) => #c(-0.48905626 1.4031192)
    (sinh -100.0d0) => -1.344058570908068d+43
