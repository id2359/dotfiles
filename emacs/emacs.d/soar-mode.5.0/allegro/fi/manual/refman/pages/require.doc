    FUNCTION
    require  -  load a module if it is not already loaded

    USAGE
    require module-name [pathnames]

    DESCRIPTION
    the argument MODULE-NAME, which can be a string or a  symbol  (in  which
    case  the  print name of the symbol is used), should be the name of some
    LISP subsystem not available by default in the version of LISP  you  are
    running.  require checks to see if it has been loaded into LISP by look-
    ing for it on the list which is the value of  *modules*.   The  test  is
    case-sensitive.   If  the  module  name  is  not  on the *modules* list,
    require loads it into LISP.  If PATHNAMES is present as a  single  path-
    name  or  a  list  of  pathnames, it loads those files in order.  If the
    argument PATHNAMES is not present, require  attempts  to  determine  (in
    some  system-dependent fashion) which files should be loaded.  The value
    returned by require is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Look for and load Euclid module if it not found on *MODULES*.
    (require "Euclid")
