    FUNCTION
    ash  -  arithmetic shift

    USAGE
    ash n count

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns an integer representing the integer N shifted COUNT bits to  the
    left  if  COUNT is positive, or shifted COUNT bits to the right if COUNT
    is negative.  The arguments must be integers, and the computation treats
    N  and  the  result as integers in two's-complement representation.  The
    sign of N is always preserved in the result.  During a left shift,  zero
    bits  are  added  on  the  right,  and  during  a  right shift, bits are
    discarded from the right and copies of the sign bit  are  added  on  the
    left.  The following mathematical identity holds:

    (ash n count) = (floor (* n (expt 2 count)))

    EXAMPLES
    (ash 1 2) => 4
    (ash 8 -2) => 2
    (ash -2 -10) => -1
