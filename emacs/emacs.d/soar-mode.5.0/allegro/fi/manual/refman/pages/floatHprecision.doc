    FUNCTION
    float-precision  -  get the number of significant digits in the internal
      representation of a floating-point number

    USAGE
    float-precision float

    DESCRIPTION
    This function returns the number  of  significant  digits  used  in  the
    internal  representation of the floating-point number FLOAT.  The digits
    are taken to  be  in  the  radix  of  the  representation  (returned  by
    float-radix).

    If the argument to float-precision is a floating-point zero,  the  value
    returned  is  zero.   The value returned by float-precision is less than
    that returned by float-digits for a denormalized floating-point number.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The value are implementation-dependent.
    (float-precision 1.0) =>  24
    (float-precision 0.0) => 0
    (float-precision 10.0d0) => 53
