    FUNCTION
    string-left-trim  -  strip characters from the beginning of a string

    USAGE
    string-left-trim char-bag string

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a substring of the string specified by STRING that has had every
    character  in  CHAR-BAG  removed  from  the beginning.  STRING must be a
    string or a symbol.  If STRING is a symbol, its print name  is  used  as
    the  string.   The  CHAR-BAG argument may be any sequence of characters.
    Characters are trimmed from the beginning  of  STRING  until  the  first
    character not in CHAR-BAG is found.

    Unless no characters are removed, the resulting string  does  not  share
    any  storage  with  the argument STRING; it is freshly allocated.  If no
    characters are removed, a copy of STRING may be returned.

    EXAMPLES
    (string-left-trim '(#\Tab #\Space #\w) "  what's up  ")
      => "hat's up  "
    (string-left-trim "," ",,,,3,4,,,,9,,5,,")
      => "3,4,,,,9,,5,,"
    (string-left-trim "[(" "{1 2 3}") => "{1 2 3}"
