    FUNCTION
    clear-output  -  abort pending output operation

    Usage
    clear-output [STREAM]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    Any outstanding output operation to the stream STREAM is aborted if pos-
    sible.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil.  This function is used for its side effects.  The  argument
    STREAM,  if  supplied,  must  be a stream, nil, or t.  If it is nil, the
    stream *standard-output* is used.  That is also the  default  value  for
    this argument.  If STREAM is T, then *terminal-io* is used.

    The operation of this function is implementation-dependent.
