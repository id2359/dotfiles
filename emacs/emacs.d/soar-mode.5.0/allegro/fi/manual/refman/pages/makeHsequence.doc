    FUNCTION
    make-sequence  -  make a sequence of a given type and size

    Usage
    make-sequence TYPE SIZE [:initial-element ELEM]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a sequence of type TYPE that is SIZE elements in length.  If you
    specify ELEM as the value of the :initial-element keyword argument, each
    sequence element will be initialized to it.  If TYPE, which  must  be  a
    subtype  of sequence, specifies the type of elements, ELEM must be of an
    appropriate type.  If ELEM is not specified, the initial contents of the
    result sequence are implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    (make-sequence '(vector fixnum) 4 :initial-element 200)
      => #(200 200 200 200)
    (make-sequence 'string 20 :initial-element #\X)
      => "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
