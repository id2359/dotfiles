    Lambda-List KEYWORD
    &body  -  bind remaining macro arguments as a list

    USAGE
    &body var

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies that during macro expansion, the parameter VAR be bound  to  a
    list of any unprocessed arguments that remain after binding the required
    and optional parameters.  If there are none left, VAR is bound  to  nil.
    It is important to note that keyword parameters are included in VAR.

    The &body lambda-list keyword is a  variant  of  &rest  which  may  only
    appear  in  defmacro lambda lists.  It is identical to &rest except that
    it may be recognized by certain editing and printing functions as  indi-
    cating  that  the  rest  of the macro call form is to be regarded as the
    body of the form (as opposed to the arguments to the macro) and  may  be
    indented appropriately.

    EXAMPLES
    (defmacro with-print-base (base &body forms)
      `(let ((*print-base* ,base))
         (declare (special *print-base*))
         ,@forms))

    (with-print-base 2 (write 1/2)) PRINTS 1/10
    (with-print-base 2 (write 1/4)) PRINTS 1/100
    (with-print-base 2 (write 1/8)) PRINTS 1/1000
