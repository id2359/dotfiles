    FUNCTION
    intern  -  find an existing symbol or create and intern a new one

    USAGE
    intern string [package]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns two values: a symbol and either nil or a keyword describing  the
    status of the symbol.  The argument STRING is a string that names a sym-
    bol.  The argument PACKAGE, which must be a package and defaults to  the
    current package (the value of *package*), is searched for a symbol whose
    print name is STRING.  If such a symbol is found, it is returned as  the
    first   value,   and  the  second  value  is  :internal,  :external,  or
    :inherited, as the symbol is internal, external, or  inherited.   If  no
    such  symbol  is  found,  one  is created and installed in PACKAGE as an
    internal symbol, and nil is returned as the second value.   (If  PACKAGE
    is the keyword package, the symbol is made external by default.)

    EXAMPLES
    (find-symbol "FOOBAR") =>  nil nil
    (intern "FOOBAR" ) => foobar nil
    (intern "FOOBAR") => foobar :internal
