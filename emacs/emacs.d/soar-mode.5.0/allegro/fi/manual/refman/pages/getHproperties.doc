    FUNCTION
    get-properties  -  retrieve property values from a property list

    USAGE
    get-properties place indicator-list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns three values after searching the property list stored  in  PLACE
    for  any  of the indicators that are in INDICATOR-LIST.  If an indicator
    is found, then the first two values returned are the indicator  and  the
    property  value  associated  with it, and the third value is the tail of
    the property list whose car is the indicator found and whose cadr is the
    value.  If no matching indicator is found then all three returned values
    are nil.  Thus, the third returned value is both  a  boolean  indicating
    whether  the  search  is  successful and the list to search for the next
    property pair.

    As with getf, an indicator on the property list at PLACE must be  eq  to
    one  of  the  indicators  in  INDICATOR-LIST for the associated property
    value to be found.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We assume the properties have already been defined:
    (get-properties 'crime-and-punishment  '(:language :author))
      => :language
         "Russian"
         (:language "Russian" :mood "depressing" :author "Dostoyevsky")
