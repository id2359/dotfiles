    FUNCTION
    logtest  -  test whether the logical `and' of two integers is zero

    USAGE
    logtest n1 n2

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if there is at least one  bit  position  where  the  two's-
    complement  representations of N1 and N2 are both 1.  Returns false oth-
    erwise.  Both arguments must be integers.  The following identity holds:

    (logtest x y) = (not (zerop (logand x y)))

    EXAMPLES
    (logtest 2 5) => nil
    (logtest 2 3) => t
