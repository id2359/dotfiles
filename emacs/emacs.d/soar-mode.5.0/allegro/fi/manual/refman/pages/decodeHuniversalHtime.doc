    FUNCTION
    decode-universal-time  -  convert universal time to decoded time

    Usage
    decode-universal UNIVERSAL-TIME [TIME-ZONE]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the time specified by UNIVERSAL-TIME as nine values  correspond-
    ing  to  the  components  of  decoded-time:  SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DATE,
    MONTH, YEAR, DAY-OF-WEEK, DAYLIGHT-SAVINGS-TIME-P, and TIME-ZONE.  These
    components  take  values in the following ranges: SECOND and MINUTE 0 to
    59; HOUR 0 to 23; DATE 1 to 31 but never more than the actual number  of
    days  in  a  month;  MONTH  1  to 12; YEAR greater than or equal to 1900
    representing the number of  the  year  in  the  Common  Era  (i.e.  AD);
    DAY-OF-WEEK  0  to 6 with Monday being 0.  TIME-ZONE is in zones west of
    Greenwich, i.e. hours less than GMT.  DAYLIGHT-SAVINGS-TIME-P  is  t  or
    nil  as  daylight-saving-time is or is not in EFFECT (not as it is or is
    not observed in your location).  If you  do  not  specify  the  optional
    TIME-ZONE  argument  (as an integer indicating hours less than GMT), the
    time-zone component of the returned decoded-time values will default  to
    the  current  TIME-ZONE on your machine.  (If you specify the TIME-ZONE,
    the returned value DAYLIGHT-SAVING-TIME-P  is  implementation-dependent.
    Some  always return nil and others return the same value as if TIME-ZONE
    had not been specified.)

    EXAMPLES
    (multiple-value-list (decode-universal-time 2398291201))
      => (1 0 16 31 12 1975 2 nil 8)
    ;;  That is 16:00:01 (one second after four pm) on Tuesday,
    ;;  the 31st of December, Pacific Standard Time.
