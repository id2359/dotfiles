    FUNCTION
    scale-float  -  scale a floating-point number in its representational
      radix

    USAGE
    scale-float float power

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a floating-point number that is scaled by  its  representational
    radix raised to an integral power.  Specifically, let radix be the radix
    of the internal representation  of  FLOAT,  (the  value  of  float-radix
    applied to FLOAT).  Then scale-float returns the value of

    (* float (expt (float radix float) power))

    The argument POWER must be an integer, and FLOAT  must  be  a  floating-
    point number.

    Alternatively, we can say that if decode-float has  been  applied  to  a
    number  X, then scale-float applied to the first two returned values and
    multiplied by the third (to obtain the correct sign), returns  a  number
    numerically identical to X.

    (multiple-value-bind (significand exponent sign)
        (decode-float x)
      (* (scale-float significant exponent) sign))
      = x

    (Note that scale-float does not require its first argument to be a  nor-
    malized significand, although that is always what decode-float returns.)

    EXAMPLES
    (scale-float 2.3  4) => 36.8
    ;;  The values of DECODE-FLOAT depend on the radix used
    ;;  for internal floating-point representation by an
    ;;  implementation.
    (decode-float -13.4) => 0.8375 4 -1.0
    ;;  But, given the values, the following holds:
    (* (scale-float 0.8375 4) -1.0) => 13.4
