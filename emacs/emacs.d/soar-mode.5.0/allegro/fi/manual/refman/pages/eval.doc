    FUNCTION
    eval  -  evaluate a form

    USAGE
    eval form

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the result of evaluating FORM.  The lexical environment for  the
    evaluation  is  null,  but the current dynamic environment is used.  The
    argument FORM is actually  evaluated  twice,  once  due  to  the  normal
    evaluation  of  the arguments to functions, and once due to the explicit
    call to eval.  The function symbol-value is useful for evaluating just a
    symbol.

    If the global variable *evalhook* is not nil, it should be  bound  to  a
    function which will be used instead of eval when any evaluation is done.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x 'y) => y
    (setq y 2) => 2
    (eval x) => 2
    (eval '(car '(alpha beta gamma))) => alpha
