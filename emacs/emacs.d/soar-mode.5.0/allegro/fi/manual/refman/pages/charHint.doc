    FUNCTION
    char-int  -  get the integer encoding of a character

    USAGE
    char-int char

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a non-negative integer encoding CHAR, which must be a  character
    object.   This  value is the same as that returned by char-code provided
    the bits and font attributes of CHAR are 0.  The  char-int  function  is
    mainly  intended  for  hashing characters.  The specific values returned
    are implementation-dependent.

    The following identity holds:

    (char= c1 c2) = (= (char-int c1) (char-int c2))

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The following results are implementation-dependent:
    (char-int #\a) => 97
    (char-int #\A) => 65
    (char-int #\Control-A) => 321
    (char-int #1\Control-A) => 65857
