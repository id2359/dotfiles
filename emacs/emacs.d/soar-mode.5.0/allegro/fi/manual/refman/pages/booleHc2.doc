    CONSTANT
    boole-c2  -  specify bitwise logical operation to return operand two
      complemented

    DESCRIPTION
    Used as the first argument to  boole  to  specify  the  bitwise  boolean
    operation  that  returns the complement of its second operand (the third
    argument to boole).

    EXAMPLES
    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (Since bitwise logical operations interpret integers as
    ;;  half-infinite, the result is negative, which in two's-
    ;;  complement representation has an infinite string of 1's
    ;;  to the right, that is toward higher-order bits.  The
    ;;  number #b-1011 would be represented in two's-complement
    ;;  as ...111110101.)
    (boole boole-c2 #b1100 #b1010) => #b-1011
    (ldb (byte 4 0) #b-1011) => #b101
    (logbitp 100 #b-1011) => t
