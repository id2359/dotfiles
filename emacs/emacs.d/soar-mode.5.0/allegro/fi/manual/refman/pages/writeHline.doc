    FUNCTION
    write-line  -  write a string followed by a newline to an output stream

    Usage
    write-line STRING [STREAM] [:start START] [:end END]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    A string of characters followed by a newline is written to a stream.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns STRING, after writing this string to the stream STREAM, and out-
    putting a newlinee.

    To write a substring of STRING, specify  the  :start  and  :end  keyword
    arguments.  The :start keyword argument indicates the index of the first
    element of the substring to write.  It defaults to zero (the first  ele-
    ment).   The  :end  keyword argument specifies an index one greater than
    the index of the last element to write.  A value of nil is equivalent to
    the  default,  the  length  of  the string.  Even if only a substring of
    STRING is written to STREAM, the  entire  string  argument,  STRING,  is
    returned.

    The argument STREAM may be a stream, t or nil, the default.   If  STREAM
    is  nil,  the  string  is written to the value of *standard-output*.  If
    STREAM is t, the string is written to the value of *terminal-io*.

    EXAMPLES
    (progn (write-line "It's time for a ...")
           (write-line "line break")) PRINTS
    It's time for a ...
    line break
