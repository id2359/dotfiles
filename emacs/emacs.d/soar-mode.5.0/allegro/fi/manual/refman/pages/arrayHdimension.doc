    FUNCTION
    array-dimension  -  get the dimension of a particular axis of an array

    USAGE
    array-dimension array axis-number

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the length of the axis (or dimension) referred to by AXIS-NUMBER
    of ARRAY.  This axis number is a non-negative integer less than the rank
    of the array.  For vectors with fill pointers, this function returns the
    total length of the vector, including inactive elements.

    EXAMPLES
    (let ((A (make-array '(2 3))))
      (values (array-dimension A 0)
              (array-dimension A 1))) => 2 3
    (array-dimension (make-array 20 :fill-pointer 15) 0) => 20
