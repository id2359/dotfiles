    FUNCTION
    y-or-n-p  -  ask the user a yes-or-no question

    Usage
    y-or-n-p [FORMAT-STRING {ARGS}*]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The question is output to the value of *query-io*.  The answer  is  read
    from the same stream.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns non-nil if the user's response is affirmative  and  nil  if  the
    response  is  negative.   If  FORMAT-STRING  is  supplied,  the function
    fresh-line is called and the format string is displayed  as  if  it  and
    ARGS were given to the function format.  Whether or not FORMAT-STRING is
    supplied, a response is expected from the user. (The query may have been
    generated   separately.)    The   range   of   acceptable  responses  is
    implementation-dependent.  However, the acceptable responses should  all
    be  simple,  such  as  entering a single character (for example ``y'' or
    ``n'') or a mouse-click.

    The argument FORMAT-STRING must be a  string.   It  may  include  format
    directives  as  specified for the format function.  If any of the format
    directives take arguments the  arguments  are  taken  sequentially  from
    ARGS.   FORMAT-STRING  should be a query that can take an affirmative or
    negative response. The query  should  not  refer  to  the  form  of  the
    response  since it is implementation-dependent, and doing so will result
    in nonportable code.  Implementations may provide information  automati-
    cally  about  how the user should respond.  (For example, the acceptable
    responses may be given if the first response is inappropriate.)

    If the possible consequences of the user's response are serious or  dif-
    ficult  to rectify, the function yes-or-no-p should be used.  This func-
    tion has the same syntax, but requires a fuller response from the user.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The specific message as well as the details of the
    ;;  script (the prompt, etc.) are implementation-dependent.
    <cl> (PROGN (SETQ X 4)
           (IF (Y-OR-N-P "SET X TO 3? ")
               (SETQ X 3)))
    Set x to 3? SURE
    Type "y" for yes or "n" for no.
    Set x to 3? Y
    3
    <cl>
