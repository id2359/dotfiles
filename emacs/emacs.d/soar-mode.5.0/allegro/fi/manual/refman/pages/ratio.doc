    Type SPECIFIER
    ratio  -  the data type comprising the ratio of two integers

    USAGE
    ratio

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a data type consisting of numbers that represent  mathematical
    ratios  of  two  integers.   there  are  two  parts  in in the canonical
    representation of a ratio, the numerator and the  denominator,  both  of
    which must be integers.  The largest common denominator of the numerator
    and denominator must be 1 and the denominator must be greater than 1.

    The printed representation of a ratio is the  numerator  followed  by  a
    slash  and then by the denominator.  Even if a number is read as a ratio
    in unreduced form, it is printed in canonical form  as  specified  above
    unless  its  value  is  integral, in which case it is an integer, and is
    printed accordingly.  integer and ratio are mutually exclusive  subtypes
    of rational.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x '(#B111/10 #O10/3 #9R10/3 3/30)) => (7/2 8/3 3 1/10)
    (mapcar #'type-of x) => (ratio ratio fixnum ratio)
    (typep 4/5 'ratio) => t
    (subtypep 'ratio 'rational) => t t
