    FUNCTION
    nreverse  -  reverse a sequence (destructive)

    Usage
    nreverse SEQUENCE

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The argument SEQUENCE may be changed  (and  need  NOT  be  the  reversed
    sequence).

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a sequence whose entries are the entries of  SEQUENCE  reversed.
    The  argument SEQUENCE, which must be a sequence, may be modified but it
    need not be eq or even equal  to  the  result  sequence  after  nreverse
    returns.

    nreverse may or may not destroy its argument, and the result may or  may
    not  be  eq  to its argument.  Therefore, it is advisable to use setq to
    change the value of a variable given to nreverse.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Note how the argument and the result
    ;;  compare in this implementation:
    (setf list1 (list 1 2 3 4)) => (1 2 3 4)
    (nreverse list1) => (4 3 2 1)
    list1 => (1)
