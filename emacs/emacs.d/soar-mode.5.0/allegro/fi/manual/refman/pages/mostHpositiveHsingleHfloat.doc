    CONSTANT
    most-positive-single-float  -  the single-float closest to positive in-
      finity

    DESCRIPTION
    This constant evaluates to the value of the single-float number  nearest
    to  (but  still  different  from)  positive infinity.  The value of this
    constant is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  This value is implementation-dependent.
    most-positive-single-float => 3.4028232e+38
