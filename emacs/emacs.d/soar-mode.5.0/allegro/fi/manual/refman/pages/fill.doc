    FUNCTION
    fill  -  replaces items in a sequence with a given item (destructive)

    Usage
    fill SEQUENCE ITEM [:start SN] [:end EN]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The argument SEQUENCE may be changed.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a sequence eq (in some implementations equal) to  SEQUENCE  with
    its elements replaced by ITEM.

    To operate on a subsequence of SEQUENCE, specify  the  :start  and  :end
    keyword  arguments.   The :start keyword argument indicates the index of
    the first element of the subsequence to modify.  Its value  defaults  to
    zero  (indicating  the first element).  The :end keyword argument speci-
    fies an index one greater than the index of the last element to  modify.
    A value of nil is equivalent to the default, the length of the sequence.
    If SEQUENCE is a vector with a fill pointer, only the active elements of
    SEQUENCE can be modified.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq foo (vector 'w 'x 'y 'z)) => #(w x y z)
    (fill foo 'a) => #(a a a a)
