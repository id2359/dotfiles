    Type SPECIFIER
    bit  -  the data type comprising 0 and 1 only.

    Usage
    bit

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a data type representing the  integers  0  and  1.   The  type
    specifier (integer 0 1) is equivalent to bit.

    The printed representation of a bit is either 0 or 1.  (If *print-radix*
    is  non-nil,  then  the  value  of  the  bit  is  preceded by the radix-
    specifier.)

    EXAMPLES
    (typep 1 'bit) => t
    (subtypep 'bit 'integer) => t t
