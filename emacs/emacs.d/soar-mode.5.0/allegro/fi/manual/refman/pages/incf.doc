    MACRO
    incf  -  increment a generalized variable

    USAGE
    incf place [delta]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The value of the generalized variable is directly modified.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the result of incrementing by  DELTA  the  generalized  variable
    named  by  PLACE.  The argument DELTA, must be a number, and defaults to
    1.  The generalized variable PLACE also must hold a  number.   The  incf
    form is conceptually similar to

    (setf place (+ place delta))

    except that the incf macro ensures that PLACE is evaluated only once.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq n 4) => r
    (incf n) => 5
    n => 5

    (setq n #c(2 3)) => #c(2 3)
    (incf n 2) => #c(4 3)
    n => #c(4 3)
