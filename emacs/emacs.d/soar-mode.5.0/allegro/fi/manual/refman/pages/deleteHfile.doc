    FUNCTION
    delete-file  -  remove a file

    USAGE
    delete-file file

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The file identified by FILE is erased from the file system.

    DESCRIPTION
    Removes the file identified by FILE, and returns a non-nil value if  the
    deletion  was successful.  If for any reason the deletion was unsuccess-
    ful, an error is signalled.

    The argument FILE must be a pathname, string, or stream.   If  it  is  a
    pathname,  it  must  not  contain  a :wild component, or a nil component
    where a nil component is not permitted by the file system.  If FILE is a
    stream,  the  precise  action  is  implementation-dependent, but the end
    result is that the file is deleted and the stream is  closed,  if  these
    actions   are   possible.    It   is   implementation-dependent  whether
    delete-file returns non-nil or signals an error when applied to  a  non-
    existent file.

    EXAMPLES
    (progn
      (with-open-file (out "junk" :direction :output
                           :if-exists :supersede)
        (prin1 'foo out))
      (list
       (null (probe-file "junk"))
       (null (delete-file "junk"))
       (null (probe-file "junk"))))
      => (nil nil t)
