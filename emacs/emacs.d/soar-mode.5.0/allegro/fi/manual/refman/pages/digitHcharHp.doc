    FUNCTION
    digit-char-p  -  test whether a character object is a digit of a given
      radix

    USAGE
    digit-char-p char [radix]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the non-negative integer value of CHAR, considered as a digit in
    radix  RADIX.  Returns nil if CHAR is not a valid single-digit character
    for RADIX.  The potential valid digit characters are #\0 through #\9 and
    #\A  through  #\Z  (or  equivalently, #\a through #\z), representing the
    values 10through 35.  RADIX must be a non-negative integer.  It defaults
    to  10.   (Some  implementations signal an error if RADIX is not a legal
    radix, that is an integer from 2 to 36 inclusive.)  Only  those  numbers
    and letters whose weight is strictly less than RADIX are actually valid.
    For them, DIGIT-CHAR-P returns their value.  For  the  others  (and  any
    other character), it returns nil.  CHAR must be a character.

    Using the default radix of 10, the characters #\0 through #\9 are digits
    whose  values  (also called weights) are 0 through 9, respectively.  For
    RADIX equal 19, the characters #\0 through #\9 and #\A through  #\I  (or
    #\a through #\i) have values 0 through 18.

    EXAMPLES
    (digit-char-p #\9) => 9
    (digit-char-p #\a) => nil
    (digit-char-p #\a 16) => 10
    (digit-char-p #\9 8) => nil
    (digit-char-p #\$) => nil
