    FUNCTION
    fceiling  -  truncate a number toward positive infinity and convert the
      result to floating-point number

    USAGE
    fceiling number [divisor]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns two values, Q and R.  Q is the result of truncating the quotient
    of  NUMBER  and  DIVISOR  toward positive infinity, converted to a float
    with the same format as NUMBER.  (If NUMBER is  an  integer,  the  first
    returned  value  is  a single-float.) R is the difference between NUMBER
    and Q times DIVISOR.  That is

    r = NUMBER - q*DIVISOR

    The truncation of a number toward  positive  infinity  is  the  smallest
    integer greater than or equal to the number.

    DIVISOR defaults to 1, so if only one argument is  provided,  the  first
    returned  value  will  be  the smallest integer greater than or equal to
    NUMBER coerced to a float with the format of NUMBER.  The format of  the
    second  returned  value  follows  the  rules of floating-point contagion
    (applied before Q is converted to a float).  Therefore, the second value
    may be an integer if both of the arguments are integers.

    Both arguments must  be  real  numbers,  either  integer,  rational,  or
    floating-point.

    EXAMPLES
    (fceiling 5.3) => 6.0 -0.7
    (fceiling 5 2) => 3.0 -1
    (fceiling 5 -2) => -2.0 -1
    (fceiling -5 2) => -2.0 -1
    (fceiling -5 -2) => 3.0 1
    (fceiling -5.2 2) => -2.0 -1.2
