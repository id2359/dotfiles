    FUNCTION
    alpha-char-p  -  test whether a character object is an alphabetic char-
      acter

    USAGE
    alpha-char-p char

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if CHAR, which must be a character object, belongs  to  the
    alphabet,  and  false otherwise.  The characters #\a through #\z and #\A
    through #\Z are alphabetic.  A character with a non-zero bits  attribute
    is  never  alphabetic.  Whether a character with non-zero font attribute
    is alphabetic depends on the implementation  and  perhaps  on  the  font
    attribute value as well.

    EXAMPLES
    (alpha-char-p #\a) => t
    (alpha-char-p #\Newline) => nil
    (alpha-char-p #\T) => t
    (alpha-char-p #\Control-X) => nil
    (alpha-char-p #\1) => nil
