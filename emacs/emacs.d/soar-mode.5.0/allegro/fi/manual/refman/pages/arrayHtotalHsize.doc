    FUNCTION
    array-total-size  -  gets the total number of elements in an array

    USAGE
    array-total-size array

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the product of the dimensions, which is the total  size  of  the
    array.  The total size of a zero-dimensional array is one, and the total
    size of a one-dimensional array  is  determined  by  ignoring  the  fill
    pointer,  so that both active and inactive elements are counted.  If any
    dimension of an array is zero, array-total-size returns 0.  The function
    array-total-size returns 1 for arrays with no elements.

    EXAMPLES
    (array-total-size (make-array nil)) => 1
    (array-total-size (make-array '(3 4))) => 12
    (array-total-size (make-array '(15) :fill-pointer 12)) => 15
    (array-total-size (make-array '(5 8 0))) => 0
