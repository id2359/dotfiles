    FUNCTION
    host-namestring  -  get the host component of a pathname

    USAGE
    host-namestring pathname

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a string representing the host component of PATHNAME, which must
    be  a  pathname, string, symbol, or stream.  If PATHNAME is a stream, it
    must be, or have been, open to a file.

    Not all the pathname components may be meaningful in any given implemen-
    tation.   It  may not necessarily be possible to construct a valid name-
    string  by  concatenating  the  values  returned   by   host-namestring,
    directory-namestring, and file-namestring on a given pathname.

    EXAMPLES
    (host-namestring (make-pathname :host "franz" :device "sys$disk"
                                    :directory "[cl.v020]"
                                    :name "cl" :type "exe")) => "franz"
