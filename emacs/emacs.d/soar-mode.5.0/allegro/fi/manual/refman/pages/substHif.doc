    FUNCTION
    subst-if  -  copy a tree replacing items that satisfy a test

    Usage
    subst-if NEWITEM PRED TREE [:key KEYFNC]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a copy of TREE in which every subtree or leaf (car  or  cdr)  at
    all  levels  satisfying  the  predicate PRED is replaced by NEWITEM.  An
    element satisfies PRED if PRED applied  to  the  element  returns  true.
    PRED  must  accept  one  argument.  This function is a variant of subst.
    While the argument TREE is not changed,  the  returned  tree  may  share
    parts with it.

    If the keyword argument :key is specified and its value  KEYFNC  is  not
    nil,  KEYFNC  must be a function which accepts one argument.  It will be
    applied to each element of TREE before that  element  is  tested.   When
    unspecified or nil, it effectively defaults to the function identity.

    EXAMPLES
    (subst-if 'x #'numberp '(a (3 b (5) 2))) => (a (x b (x) x))
    (subst-if 'x #'null '(a (b a (a) c)))
      => (a (b a (a . x) c . x) . x)
    (subst-if nil #'consp '(1 (2 (3)))) => nil
