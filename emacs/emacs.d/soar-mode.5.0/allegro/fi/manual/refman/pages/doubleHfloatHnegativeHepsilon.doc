    CONSTANT
    double-float-negative-epsilon  -  smallest distinguishable double-float
      decrement

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the value of the smallest positive double-float number that  can
    be subtracted from -1 to produce a value distinct from -1.  The value of
    this constant is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The returned value is implementation-dependent.
    double-float-negative-epsilon => 2.220446049250313d-16
