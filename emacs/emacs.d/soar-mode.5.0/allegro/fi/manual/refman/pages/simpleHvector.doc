    Type SPECIFIER
    simple-vector  -  the data type comprising simple vectors

    USAGE
    {simple-vector | (&Esimple-vector [size])}

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a data type consisting of simple vectors  (see  vector)  of  a
    size  given by the non-negative integer SIZE.  A simple vector is a vec-
    tor that has no fill pointer, is not adjustable, and is not displaced to
    another  array.   This specifier is equivalent to (simple-array t SIZE).
    SIZE may be explicitly unspecified using *.  A list specifier  that  has
    an asterisk in place of SIGN may be replaced by simple-vector.

    EXAMPLES
    (subtypep 'simple-vector 'vector) => t t
    (subtypep '(simple-vector 5) '(vector (mod 16) 5)) => nil t
