    FUNCTION
    third  -  get the third element of a list

    USAGE
    third list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the third element of LIST, where the car of LIST  is  considered
    to be the first element.  LIST must be a list.

    Unlike the nth function, which uses zero-origin indexing, this  function
    uses  one-origin  indexing.   If the list has fewer than three elements,
    nil is returned.  setf may be used with third to replace the third  ele-
    ment of a list.

    EXAMPLES
    (third '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => c
    (third '(a)) => nil
    (setq lis '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => (a b c d e f g h i j)
    (setf (third lis) 3) => 3
    lis => (a b 3 d e f g h i j)
