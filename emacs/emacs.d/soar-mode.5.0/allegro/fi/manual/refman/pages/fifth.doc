    FUNCTION
    fifth  -  return the fifth element of a list

    USAGE
    fifth list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the fifth element of LIST, where the car of LIST  is  considered
    to be the first element.  LIST must be a list.

    Unlike the nth function, which uses zero-origin indexing, this  function
    uses one-origin indexing.  If the list has fewer than five elements, nil
    is returned.  setf may be used with fifth to replace the  fifth  element
    of a list.

    EXAMPLES
    (fifth '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => e
    (fifth '(a)) => nil
    (setq lis '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => (a b c d e f g h i j)
    (setf (fifth lis) 5) => 5
    lis => (a b c d 5 f g h i j)
