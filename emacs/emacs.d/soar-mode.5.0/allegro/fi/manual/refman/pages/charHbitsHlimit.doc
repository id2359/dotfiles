    CONSTANT
    char-bits-limit  -  upper exclusive bound on character bits values

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to a non-negative integer  representing  the  upper  exclusive
    bound  on  character  bits  values returned by char-bits.  This value is
    implementation-dependent, but must be a power of 2.  If  an  implementa-
    tion  does  not  support  bits attributes of characters, char-bits-limit
    will be 1.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  This value is implementation-dependent:
    char-bits-limit => 16
