    FUNCTION
    string-upcase  -  convert string to uppercase

    USAGE
    string-upcase string [:start sn] [:end en]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a new string that contains the same characters as STRING  except
    that all lowercase characters are replaced by their corresponding upper-
    case characters.  STRING must be a string or a symbol.  If it is a  sym-
    bol, its print name is used as the string.

    The  characters  of  the  returned  string  are  produced  by   applying
    char-upcase to the characters of STRING.


    To operate on a substring of STRING, specify the :start and :end keyword
    arguments.  The :start keyword argument indicates the index of the first
    character of the substring to  examine.   Its  value  defaults  to  zero
    (indicating  the  first character).  The :end keyword argument specifies
    an index one greater than the index of the last character to examine.  A
    value of nil is equivalent to the default, the length of the string.

    If STRING is a string with a fill pointer, only the active  elements  of
    STRING  can  be  processed.   Regardless of the substring specified, the
    returned string is the same length as (the active length of) STRING.

    EXAMPLES
    (string-upcase "Are you sure it's man-made?")
      => "ARE YOU SURE IT'S MAN-MADE?"
    (string-upcase "Are you sure it's man-made?" :start 8 :end 17)
      => "Are you SURE IT'S man-made?"
    (string-upcase 'panIC) => "PANIC"
