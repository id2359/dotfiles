    FUNCTION
    truncate  -  truncate a number toward zero

    USAGE
    truncate number [divisor]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns two values.  When only NUMBER is provided as  an  argument,  the
    returned values are the result Q, of truncating NUMBER toward 0, and the
    remainder R.  In this case, Q + R = NUMBER.  The result of truncating  a
    number  toward  0 is the largest non-negative integer less than or equal
    to a positive number and the smallest non-positive integer greater  than
    or equal to a negative number.

    When the optional argument DIVISOR is  also  given,  the  truncation  is
    applied  to  the  quotient of NUMBER and DIVISOR.  The remainder is com-
    puted in such a way that (Q * DIVISOR)  +  R  =  NUMBER.   In  the  two-
    argument  case,  R  is  an  integer  if  both  arguments are integers, a
    rational if they are both  rational,  and  a  floating-point  number  if
    either argument is floating-point.

    EXAMPLES
    (truncate .99) => 0 0.99
    (truncate 3 2) => 1 1
    (truncate -1.5) => -1 -0.5
