    DEFSTRUCT OPTION
    :print-function  -  specify how a structure should be printed

    Usage
    :print-function FUN

    DESCRIPTION
    This is a defstruct option that is  used  to  control  the  printing  of
    structure  instances.   It may not be used if the :type option is speci-
    fied.  The argument FUN must be a function in  a  form  suitable  as  an
    argument  to  function.   When  the  function is called it will be given
    three arguments: an instance of the structure, the stream to  which  the
    output  will go, and the current printing depth.  The default structure-
    printing function uses #S syntax.  The specified printing function  must
    observe  print  control variables such as *print-level* (the depth argu-
    ment indicates the current level) and *print-escape*.

    EXAMPLES
    (defstruct (fraction (:print-function
                          (lambda (struct stream depth)
                            (declare (ignore depth))
                            (format stream "~D/~D"
                                    (fraction-num struct)
                                    (fraction-denom struct)))))
      num denom) => fraction
    (make-fraction :num 2 :denom 3) => 2/3
