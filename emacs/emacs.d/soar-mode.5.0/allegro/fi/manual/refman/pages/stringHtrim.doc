    FUNCTION
    string-trim  -  strip characters from the beginning and end of a string

    USAGE
    string-trim char-bag string

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a substring of the string specified by STRING that has had every
    character  in  CHAR-BAG removed from the beginning and end.  STRING must
    be a string or a symbol.  If STRING is a symbol, its print name is  used
    as the string.  The CHAR-BAG argument may be any sequence of characters.
    Characters are trimmed from the beginning and from  the  end  of  STRING
    until the first character not in CHAR-BAG is found.

    Unless no characters are removed, the resulting string  does  not  share
    any  storage  with  the argument STRING; it is freshly allocated.  If no
    characters are removed, a copy of STRING may be returned.

    EXAMPLES
    (string-trim '(#\Tab #\Space #\Newline 'p #\w) " what's up
            ")
      => "hat's up"
    (string-trim "," ",,,,3,4,,,,9,,5,,")
      => "3,4,,,,9,,5"
    (string-trim "[()]" "{1 2 3}") => "{1 2 3}"
