    FUNCTION
    rem  -  return remainder after truncation

    USAGE
    rem number divisor

    DESCRIPTION
    Return the difference between NUMBER and the product of DIVISOR and  the
    quotient  of NUMBER and DIVISOR truncated toward 0.  In other words, rem
    returns the same value as the second value returned by truncate  applied
    to the same arguments.

    Both arguments must be real numbers.  The type of the result  is  deter-
    mined  by the rules of floating point contagion.  In particular, if both
    arguments are integers the result is an integer, if both  are  rational,
    the  result  is  rational, and if either is a floating-point number, the
    result is a floating-point number.

    EXAMPLES
    (rem 17 6) => 5
    (rem 17 -6) => 5
    (rem -17 6) => -5
    (rem -17 -6) => -5
    (rem 1/4 1/2) => 1/4
    (rem 11.5 2) => 1.5
