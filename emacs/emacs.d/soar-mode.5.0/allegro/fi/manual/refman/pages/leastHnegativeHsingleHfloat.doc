    CONSTANT
    least-negative-single-float  -  negative single-float closest to zero

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the value of the negative single-float number  nearest  to  (but
    still  different from) zero.  This value is implementation-dependent but
    is guaranteed not to be minus zero (if the implementation  has  distinct
    signed floating-point zeroes).

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  This value is implementation-dependent.
    least-negative-single-float => -1.1754944e-38
