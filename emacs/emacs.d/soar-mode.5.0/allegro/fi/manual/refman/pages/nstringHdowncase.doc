    FUNCTION
    nstring-downcase  -  convert string to lowercase (destructive)

    USAGE
    nstring-downcase string [:start sn] [:end en]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The argument STRING is changed.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns STRING after modifying it as  string-downcase  would  given  the
    same  arguments.   In  the  returned  string,  all uppercase letters are
    replaced by the corresponding lowercase letters.  The characters of  the
    returned string are produced by applying char-downcase to the characters
    of STRING.

    To operate on a substring of STRING, specify values for the  :start  and
    :end  keyword  arguments.  The :start keyword indicates the index of the
    first character of the substring to modify.  Its value defaults to  zero
    (the  first  character  of STRING).  The :end keyword specifies an index
    one greater than the index of the last character to examine. A value  of
    nil is equivalent to the default, the length of the string.

    Regardless of the values of SN and EN, the length of the returned string
    is  the  same  as  the  length of STRING.  The argument STRING must be a
    string.  It cannot be a symbol.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq s "panIC")
    (nstring-downcase s) => "panic"
    s => "panic"
    (nstring-downcase "Are you SURE it's man-made?")
      => "are you sure it's man-made?"
    (nstring-downcase "Are you SURE it's man-made?"
      :start 8 :end 17) => "Are you sure it's man-made?"
