    FUNCTION
    truename  -  convert pathname, string, symbol, or stream into fully
      specified pathname of existing file

    USAGE
    truename object

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a pathname equivalent to  OBJECT,  which  must  be  a  pathname,
    string,  symbol,  or  stream  associated  with  an  existing file system
    object.  In computing the returned pathname, OBJECT is  subject  to  any
    file-name  translations  performed by the file system.  An error is sig-
    nalled if no file corresponding to OBJECT can be found.

    EXAMPLES
    (pathnamep (truename "foo")) => ERROR
    ;;  We tried to apply pathnamep to a non-existing file.
    (truename "~dm/cvar") => #p"/usr/fridge/dm/cvar"
    ;;  Note that the ~ is expanded to a full directory specification.
    ;;  Such translations are file-system dependent.
