    MACRO
    locally  -  make local pervasive declarations

    USAGE
    locally {declaration}* {form}*

    DESCRIPTION
    This form provides a localized scope for declarations.  Each DECLARATION
    is  an  instance of the declare special form.  Each FORM is a form to be
    evaluated, and will be within  the  scope  of  the  local  declarations.
    Declarations  effecting  variable  bindings  are  not meaningful because
    locally establishes no bindings.  Variables may be declared  special  to
    affect references to them within the locally forms.

    This form returns the values of the last FORM, or nil in the  degenerate
    case when there are no FORMS.  The following forms are equivalent:

    (locally x y z) = (let nil x y z)

    EXAMPLES
    (locally
      (declare (inline exp)(optimize speed))
      (exp 0)) => 1.0
