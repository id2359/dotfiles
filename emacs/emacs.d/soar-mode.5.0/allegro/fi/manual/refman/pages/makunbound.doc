    FUNCTION
    makunbound  -  cause a symbol to become unbound

    USAGE
    makunbound sym

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The value associated with the visible inner dynamic binding of the vari-
    able  SYM,  or  the  global  value if there is no inner binding, is made
    undefined.  It is an error to subsequently try to access  the  value  of
    the  unbound variable, although implementations are not required to sig-
    nal this error.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the symbol SYM.  This function is used for its side effects.  If
    removes  the  value associated with a dynamic binding of SYM, or removes
    the global value if there is no inner binding.   Only  dynamic  bindings
    and  global  values  are  affected.  Lexically-bound variables cannot be
    made undefined.

    EXAMPLES
    (defvar *s* 10)
    (let ((*s* 20))
      (declare (special *s*))
      (makunbound '*s*)
      (boundp '*s*)) => nil
    *s* => 10
    (makunbound '*s*)
    ;;  Now the symbol is no longer bound.
    *s* => ERROR
