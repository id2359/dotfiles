    FUNCTION
    char-equal  -  test whether given characters are all the same, ignoring
      case and bits

    USAGE
    char-equal {char}+

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if each CHAR is identical to every  other  CHAR  specified,
    ignoring  case  and  bits attributes and taking into account font attri-
    butes in an implementation-dependent way.  Returns false otherwise.  Two
    characters  are  considered  identical by this function when they differ
    only in case.  If two characters differ in their font  attributes,  they
    may or may not be identical depending upon the implementation and possi-
    bly upon the font attributes.  Each CHAR must  be  a  character  object.
    The  function  char= is like char-equal except that it also checks case,
    and bits and font attributes.

    equalp uses char-equal to compare characters.

    EXAMPLES
    (char-equal #\b #\b) => t
    (char-equal #\b #\c) => nil
    (char-equal #\b #\B) => t
    (char-equal #\b) => t
    (char-equal #\a #\A #\Control-A) => t
