    FUNCTION
    char/=  -  assert that given characters are all different

    USAGE
    char/= {char}+

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if each CHAR is not equal to every  other  CHAR  specified,
    and false otherwise.  Each CHAR must be a character object.  Two charac-
    ters that differ in code, bits, or font attributes  are  considered  not
    equal  by  this  function.   The  function char-not-equal is like char/=
    except that it ignores case and bits attributes.

    EXAMPLES
    (char/= #\b #\b) => nil
    (char/= #\b #\c) => t
    (char/= #\b #\B) => t
    (char-not-equal #\b #\B) => nil
    (char/= #\b) => t
    (char/= #\a #\b #\c) => t
