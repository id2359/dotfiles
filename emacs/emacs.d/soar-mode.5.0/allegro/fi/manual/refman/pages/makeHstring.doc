    FUNCTION
    make-string  -  make a simple string of a given size

    USAGE
    make-string size [:initial-element elem]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a simple string that is  SIZE  characters  in  length.   If  you
    specify  a  character  object  ELEM as the value of the :initial-element
    keyword argument, each character of the string will  be  initialized  to
    it.   If  the  initial element is not specified, the initial contents of
    the string are implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    (make-string 6 :initial-element #\Space) => "      "
    (make-string 20 :initial-element #\X) => "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
