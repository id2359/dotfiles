    READER SYNTAX
    #r  -  representation of a rational number in a specified radix

    Usage
    #NR...

    DESCRIPTION
    Reads as a rational number expressed in the radix specified by N.

    When the reader reads the dispatch-macro character ``#'', followed by  a
    nonempty  unsigned  DECIMAL  digit  string,  followed by ``r'' or ``R'',
    these characters are discarded  and  the  next  token  is  read  as  the
    representation of a rational number.  The radix of the representation is
    that specified by the decimal digit  string,  which  is  required.   The
    ``#r''  syntactic  form  reads as the rational number represented by the
    token.

    While N may be 2, 8, or 16, specific reader macros exist for these  com-
    mon  radixes.   Decimal  integers  may  be  read with a trailing decimal
    point; decimal rationals require the radix specifier #10r if *read-base*
    is not 10.  Floating-point numbers are always read in decimal.

    Rational numbers are self-evaluating objects.  (In fact all numbers  are
    self-evaluating.)

    EXAMPLES
    #32r40/M0 => 2/11
    #36rlaugh => 35777969

    (setf *read-base* 20.)
    #32r40/M0 => 2/11

    (setf *print-base* 36.)
    #32r40/M0 => 2/b
    10. => a
    10 => k

    (setf *read-base* 36.)
    (|SETF| |*PRINT-BASE*| 36.)
    fudge/gelato => 7x6q7/87aneu
