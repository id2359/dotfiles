    FUNCTION
    probe-file  -  test whether a file exists, returning its true name

    USAGE
    probe-file file

    DESCRIPTION
    This function looks for a file denoted by FILE, returning its true  name
    (in  the manner of truename) if it exists and returning nil if it cannot
    be found.  FILE must be a pathname, string, or  stream.   This  function
    will not return nil if FILE is a stream open to a file.

    A similar effect is achieved when open is  called  with  :probe  as  the
    value  of the :direction keyword argument.  Also note that the true name
    of a file may be different from the namestring of its  pathname  because
    of system-dependent translations and expansions of elements of the path-
    name.

    EXAMPLES
    (progn
      (with-open-file (out "junk" :direction :output
                           :if-exists :supersede)
        (prin1 'foo out))
      (list
       (null (probe-file "junk"))
       (null (delete-file "junk"))
       (null (probe-file "junk"))))
      => (nil nil t)
