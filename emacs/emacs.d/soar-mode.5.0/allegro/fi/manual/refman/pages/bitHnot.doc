    FUNCTION
    bit-not  -  perform a bitwise logical `not' of the elements of an array

    USAGE
    bit-not bit-array [result-array]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    If RESULT-ARRAY is provided as  an  argument,  then  it  will  hold  the
    results  of  the  logical  operation and thus be modified.  RESULT-ARRAY
    must be a bit array of the same rank and dimensions as BIT-ARRAY.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns an array whose elements are each the bitwise  logical  `not'  of
    the  corresponding  element  of  BIT-ARRAY.   If  the  optional argument
    RESULT-ARRAY is not provided, a new bit array is created  and  returned.
    The logical `not' of a bit is 1 if and only if the bit is 0.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  #* is the reader macro for bit vectors.
    (setq bit-arr (make-array 2 :element-type 'bit))
    (bit-not #*10 bit-arr) => #*01
    bit-arr => #*01
