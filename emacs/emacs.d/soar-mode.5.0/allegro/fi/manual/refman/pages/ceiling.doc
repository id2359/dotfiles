    FUNCTION
    ceiling  -  truncate a number toward positive infinity

    USAGE
    ceiling number [divisor]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns two values: the result, Q, of truncating the quotient of  NUMBER
    and  DIVISOR  towards positive infinity, and the remainder, R.  In other
    words, the smallest integer greater than or equal  to  the  quotient  of
    NUMBER and DIVISOR is returned, along with the difference between NUMBER
    and the product of Q and DIVISOR.  DIVISOR defaults to 1, so if  DIVISOR
    is  not  provided,  the  first  returned  value  is the smallest integer
    greater than or equal to NUMBER.   The  following  formula  relates  the
    arguments to the results: (Q * DIVISOR) + R = NUMBER.  If DIVISOR is not
    specified, Q + R = NUMBER.  The remainder R is an integer if both  argu-
    ments  are  integers,  a  rational  if  they  are  both  rational, and a
    floating-point number if either argument is a floating-point number.

    EXAMPLES
    (ceiling .875) => 1 -0.125
    (ceiling -1.5) => -1 -0.5
    (ceiling 3 2) => 2 -1
    (ceiling 1.0 2.0) => 1 -1.0
    (ceiling 1.0 -2.0) => 0 1.0
    (ceiling -1.0 2.0) => 0 -1.0
    (ceiling -1.0 -2.0)  => 1 1.0
