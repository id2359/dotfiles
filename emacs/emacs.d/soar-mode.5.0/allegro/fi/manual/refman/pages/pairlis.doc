    FUNCTION
    pairlis  -  make an association list given separate lists of keys and
      data

    USAGE
    pairlis keys data [a-list]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns an association list formed by associating elements of  the  KEYS
    list  with  corresponding  elements of the DATA list.  It is an error if
    these lists do not have the same number of elements.   If  the  optional
    argument  A-LIST is specified, it is taken to be an association list and
    the newly-associated elements will be added to the  front  of  it.   The
    order of the newly-associated elements in the resulting association list
    is undefined.

    EXAMPLES
    (pairlis '(red blue) '(3 4))
      => ((blue . 4) (red . 3))
    (pairlis '(red blue) '(3 4) '((green . 5)))
      => ((blue . 4) (red . 3) (green . 5))
