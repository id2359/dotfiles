    CONSTANT
    long-float-negative-epsilon  -  smallest distinguishable long-float de-
      crement

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the value of the smallest positive long-float number that can be
    subtracted  from  -1  to produce a value distinct from -1.  The value of
    this constant is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The returned value is implementation-dependent.
    long-float-negative-epsilon => 2.220446049250313d-16
