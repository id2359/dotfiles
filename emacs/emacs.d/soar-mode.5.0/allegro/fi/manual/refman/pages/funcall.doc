    FUNCTION
    funcall  -  apply a function to arguments

    USAGE
    funcall FUN {ARGUMENTS}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the result of applying FUN to the arguments.  FUN  should  be  a
    function,  not  a macro or a special form.  Note that since funcall is a
    function, FUN is evaluated.  If FUN evaluates to a  symbol,  the  global
    function definition of that symbol is used as the function to be called.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq lis '(car cadr cdr))
    (funcall (car lis) '(a b c)) => a
