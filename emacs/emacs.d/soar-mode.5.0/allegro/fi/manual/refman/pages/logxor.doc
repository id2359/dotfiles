    FUNCTION
    logxor  -  bitwise logical `exclusive or'

    USAGE
    logxor {n}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bitwise logical `exclusive or'  of  its  arguments,  all  of
    which must be integers.  If no arguments are provided, 0 is returned.  0
    is the identity for this function.  Arguments  and  results  are  inter-
    preted as if represented in two's-complement notation.

    EXAMPLES
    (logxor) => 0
    (logxor 1) => 1
    (logxor 3 5) => 6

    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (The printer drops leading zeros when printing integers.
    ;;  The printed number #b110 is equivalent to #b0110.)
    (logxor #b1100 #b1010) => #b110
