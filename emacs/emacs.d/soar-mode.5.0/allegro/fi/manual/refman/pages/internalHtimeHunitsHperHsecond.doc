    CONSTANT
    internal-time-units-per-second  -  number of internal units per second
      in the internal representation of time

    DESCRIPTION
    The value of this constant is the integer that  is  the  implementation-
    dependent  number  of  internal time units in one second.  The functions
    get-internal-real-time and get-internal-run-time  return  integers  that
    represent time in internal units.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  This value is implementation-dependent.
    internal-time-units-per-second => 1000
