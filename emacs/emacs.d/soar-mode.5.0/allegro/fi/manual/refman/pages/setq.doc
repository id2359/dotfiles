    SPECIAL FORM
    setq  -  simple assignment statement (destructive)

    USAGE
    setq {var form}*

    SIDE EFFECTS
    For each variable VAR the result of evaluating FORM is stored in VAR.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the result of the last form evaluated but this special  form  is
    used  for its side effects.  The setq form is the standard way to change
    the value of the binding of a local variable or the value of the dynamic
    binding  (or global value if there is no binding) of a special variable.
    The VAR and FORM pairs are evaluated sequentially from  left  to  right.
    The new values of variables assigned earlier in the setq form are there-
    fore available to later FORMS.

    VAR, which is not evaluated, must be  a  symbol.   The  degenerate  form
    (setq) returns nil.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x 4)
    x => 4
    (setq x '(a b c) y '(d e f)) => (d e f)
    x => (a b c)
    y => (d e f)
    (setq x 4 y (+ x 1)) => 5
