    FUNCTION
    rassoc-if-not  -  return from an association list the first key-datum
      pair where the datum does not satisfy a test

    USAGE
    rassoc-if-not pred a-list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the first pair in the association list A-LIST such that the  cdr
    of  the  pair does not satisfy the predicate PRED, or nil if there is no
    such pair.  PRED must accept one argument.  This is  a  variant  of  the
    rassoc function and the complement of assoc-if-not: whereas assoc-if-not
    finds a key which fails PRED, rassoc-if-not finds a  datum  which  fails
    PRED.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x '((a . 4) (d . 3) (c . 1) (d . 2)))
      => ((a . 4) (d . 3) (c . 1) (d . 2))
    (rassoc-if-not #'numberp x) => nil
    (rassoc-if-not #'symbolp x) => (a . 4)
    (rassoc-if-not #'evenp x) => (d . 3)
