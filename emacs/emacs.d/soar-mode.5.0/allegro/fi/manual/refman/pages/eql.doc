    FUNCTION
    eql  -  test whether two objects are conceptually identical

    USAGE
    eql x y

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if arguments X and Y are eq  (implementationally  identical
    objects),  or if they are numbers of the same value and type, or charac-
    ter objects representing the same character.  eql is provided in  COMMON
    LISP to cover the latter two cases, since such objects are in some sense
    the same but need not be eq in an implementation.  eql  is  the  default
    comparison  predicate  used  by the sequence functions that act based on
    comparison of sequence elements and other  objects.   (Examples  include
    count, remove, substitute, and many others.)

    Not all objects having the same printed representation are eql.  (Copies
    of  conses and lists are not eql to one another, for example.) Moreover,
    constants which are eql in compiled code may not be eql  in  interpreted
    code.  Any two objects that are eq are necessarily eql.

    EXAMPLES
    (eql 'a 'a) => t
    (eql 2.0 2.0) => t
    (eql #c(1.0 2.0) #c(1.0 2.0)) => t
    (eql #\a #\a) => t
    (eql (cons 'a 'b) (cons 'a 'b)) => nil
