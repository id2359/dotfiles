    FUNCTION
    remhash  -  remove a hash-table entry (destructive)

    USAGE
    remhash key hash-table

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The hash-table entry for KEY is removed.

    DESCRIPTION
    Removes from HASH-TABLE any entry for KEY, and returns a predicate value
    that  is  true  if  and only such an entry was found (and removed).  KEY
    succeeds.  The argument HASH-TABLE must be of type hash-table,  but  KEY
    may be any LISP object.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq ht (make-hash-table))
    (remhash 'quick ht) => nil
    (progn
      (setf (gethash 'quick ht) 'brown)
      (setf (gethash 'fox ht) 'jumped)
      (setf (gethash 'over ht) 'fence)
      (list (gethash 'quick ht) (gethash 'fox ht)
       (remhash 'fox ht) (gethash 'fox ht)))
      => (brown jumped t nil)
    (hash-table-count ht) => 2
    (remhash 'quick ht) => t
    (hash-table-count ht) => 1
