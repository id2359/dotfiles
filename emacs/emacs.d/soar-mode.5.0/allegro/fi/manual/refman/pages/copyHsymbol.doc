    FUNCTION
    copy-symbol  -  create a new uninterned symbol

    USAGE
    copy-symbol sym [copy-props]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns a new uninterned symbol with the same print  name  as  SYM.   If
    COPY-PROPS is non-nil, then the initial value and function definition of
    the new symbol will be the same as those of SYM, and the  property  list
    of  SYM  will  be  copied to the new symbol's property list as well.  If
    COPY-PROPS is nil, or not specified, however, the new symbol is unbound,
    undefined, and has an empty property-list.

    EXAMPLES
    (setf (get 'bob 'age) 15) => 15
    (setq stranger (copy-symbol 'bob t)) => #:bob
    (get 'bob 'age) => 15
    (get stranger 'age) => 15
    (eq stranger 'bob) => nil
    (symbol-name stranger) => "bob"
