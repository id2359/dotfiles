                                                              *error-output*


    VARIABLE
    *error-output*  -  stream to which error messages are printed

    USAGE
    *error-output*

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to an output stream that is used  as  the  default  for  error
    messages.  Note that if an error is encountered while trying to write to
    *error-output*, error will be called recursively.  Thus you should exer-
    cise caution when binding or setting the value of *error-output*.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  Create a log file for errors.
    (setf *error-output*
      (make-broadcast-stream *standard-output*
                             (setf *error-log*
                               (open "errors.log" :direction :output
                                     :if-does-not-exist :create
                                     :if-exists :append))))
    ;;  The error message will now appear both at
    ;;  the user's console and in the log file.
