    FUNCTION
    alphanumericp  -  test whether a character object is alphabetic or
      numeric

    USAGE
    alphanumericp char

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns true if CHAR, which must be a character object, is either alpha-
    betic  or  numeric,  and  false  otherwise.  The standard characters #\0
    through #\9, #\a through #\z, and #\A through #\Z are  alphanumeric.   A
    character with a non-zero bits attribute is never alphanumeric.  Whether
    a character with non-zero font attribute is alphanumeric depends on  the
    implementation  and  perhaps the font attribute value as well.  The fol-
    lowing identity holds:

    (alphanumericp x)
      = (or (alpha-char-p x) (not (null (digit-char-p x))))

    EXAMPLES
    (alphanumericp #\a) => t
    (alphanumericp #\Newline) => nil
    (alphanumericp #\T) => t
    (alphanumericp #\8) => t
