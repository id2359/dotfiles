    MACRO
    pop  -  pop an object from the front of a list (destructive)

    USAGE
    pop place

    SIDE EFFECTS
    The value stored in PLACE is changed.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the car of the contents of the generalized variable PLACE.   The
    cdr  of  the  contents  is stored back into PLACE as a side effect.  The
    form PLACE may be any generalized variable acceptable to setf,  as  long
    as  it  contains a list.  The form (pop PLACE) is similar to (prog1 (car
    PLACE) (setf PLACE (cdr PLACE))) but the pop form  only  evaluates  sub-
    forms of PLACE once and also may be more efficient.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq z '(2 3 4)) => (2 3 4)
    (pop z) => 2
    z => (3 4)
