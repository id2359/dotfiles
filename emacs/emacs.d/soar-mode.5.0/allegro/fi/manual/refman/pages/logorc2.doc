    FUNCTION
    logorc2  -  bitwise logical `or', complementing the second argument

    USAGE
    logorc2 n1 n2

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the bit-wise logical `or' of N1 and the complement of N2.   Both
    arguments must be integers.  Arguments and results are interpreted as if
    represented in two's-complement notation.  The following identity holds:

    (logorc2 x y) = (logior x (lognot y))

    EXAMPLES
    (logorc2 1 -5) => 5

    (setf *print-base* 2
          *print-radix* t)
    ;;  (Since bitwise logical operations interpret integers as
    ;;  half-infinite, the result is negative, which in two's-
    ;;  complement representation has an infinite string of 1's
    ;;  to the right, that is toward higher-order bits.  The
    ;;  number #b-11 would be represented in two's-complement
    ;;  as ...1111101.)
    (logorc2 #b1100 #b1010) => #b-11
    (ldb (byte 4 0) #b-11) => #b1101
    (logbitp 100 #b-11) => t
