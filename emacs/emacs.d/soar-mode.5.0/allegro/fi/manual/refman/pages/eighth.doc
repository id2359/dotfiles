    FUNCTION
    eighth  -  get the eighth element of a list

    USAGE
    eighth list

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the eighth element of LIST, where the car of LIST is  considered
    to be the first element.  LIST must be a list.

    Unlike the nth function, which uses zero-origin indexing, this  function
    uses  one-origin  indexing.   If the list has fewer than eight elements,
    nil is returned.  setf may be used with eighth  to  replace  the  eighth
    element of a list.

    EXAMPLES
    (eighth '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => h
    (eighth '(a)) => nil
    (setq lis '(a b c d e f g h i j)) => (a b c d e f g h i j)
    (setf (eighth lis) 8) => 8
    lis => (a b c d e f g 8 i j)
