    Type SPECIFIER
    simple-bit-vector  -  the data type comprising simple arrays specialized
      to hold bits

    USAGE
    {simple-bit-vector | (&Esimple-bit-vector [size])}

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a data type consisting of simple bit-vectors of  length  SIZE,
    which  may  be  explicitly  unspecified using *.  This type specifier is
    equivalent to (simple-array bit (SIZE)).  An array is a simple array  if
    it  has  no  fill  pointer,  is  not adjustable, and is not displaced to
    another array.

    Bit vectors and strings are two array specializations provided by  every
    implementation.

    EXAMPLES
    (type-of #*10101) => (simple-array bit (5))
    (typep #*10101 '(simple-bit-vector 5)) => t
    (subtypep '(simple-bit-vector 100)
              '(simple-bit-vector *)) => t t
