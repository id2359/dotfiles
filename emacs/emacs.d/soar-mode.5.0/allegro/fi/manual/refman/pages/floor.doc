    FUNCTION
    floor  -  truncate a number towards negative infinity

    USAGE
    floor number [divisor]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns two values: the result, Q, of truncating the quotient of  NUMBER
    and  DIVISOR  towards negative infinity, and the remainder, R.  In other
    words, the largest integer less than or equal to the quotient of  NUMBER
    and  DIVISOR  is  returned, along with the difference between NUMBER and
    the product of Q and DIVISOR.  DIVISOR defaults to 1, so if  DIVISOR  is
    not  provided, the first returned value is the largest integer less than
    or equal to NUMBER.

    The arguments NUMBER and DIVISOR  must  both  be  real  numbers,  either
    integer  or floating-point.  The format of R, the second returned value,
    follows the rules of floating-point contagion.  It will be an integer if
    both arguments are integers.

    EXAMPLES
    (floor .99) => 0 0.99
    (floor -1.5) => -2 0.5
    (floor 3 2) => 1 1
    (floor 1/2 1/2) => 1 0
