    CONSTANT
    double-float-epsilon  -  smallest distinguishable double-float increment

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the value of the smallest positive double-float number that  can
    be  added  to  1  to produce a value distinct from 1.  The value of this
    constant is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The returned value is implementation-dependent.
    double-float-epsilon => 2.220446049250313d-16
