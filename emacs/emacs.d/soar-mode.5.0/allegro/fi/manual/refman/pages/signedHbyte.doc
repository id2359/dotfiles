    Type SPECIFIER
    signed-byte  -  specify a subtype of integers that can be represented by
      a given number of bits.

    USAGE
    {signed-byte | (&Esigned-byte [n])}

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a data type consisting of  integers  that  can  be  stored  in
    two's-complement form in N bits.  If K equals 2 raised to the power N-1,
    then this type specifier is equivalent to (integer -K  K-1).   The  type
    specifiers  (signed-byte  *)  or  just  signed-byte  are  equivalent  to
    integer.

    EXAMPLES
    (typep #B1010 '(signed-byte 3)) => nil
    (typep #B1010 '(signed-byte 5)) => t
