    CONSTANT
    single-float-negative-epsilon  -  smallest distinguishable single-float
      decrement

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to the smallest positive single-float number that can be  sub-
    tracted  from -1 to produce a value distinct from -1.  The value of this
    constant is implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The returned value is implementation-dependent.
    single-float-negative-epsilon => 1.1920929e-7
