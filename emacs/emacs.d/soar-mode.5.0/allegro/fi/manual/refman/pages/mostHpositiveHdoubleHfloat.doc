    CONSTANT
    most-positive-double-float  -  the double-float closest to positive in-
      finity

    DESCRIPTION
    This constant evaluates to the value of the double-float number  nearest
    to  (but  still  different  from)  positive  infinity.   This  value  is
    implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  This value is implementation-dependent.
    most-positive-double-float => 4.4942328371557866d+307
