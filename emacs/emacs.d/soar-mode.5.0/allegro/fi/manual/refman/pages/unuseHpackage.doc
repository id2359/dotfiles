    FUNCTION
    unuse-package  -  remove some packages from the use-list of a specified
      package

    USAGE
    unuse-package packages-to-unuse [package]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns t after removing PACKAGES-TO-UNUSE from  the  list  of  packages
    used  by  PACKAGE.   PACKAGE  must  be a package, string, or symbol, and
    PACKAGES-TO-UNUSE may be  a  single  package  specification  (a  package
    object  or  a  string  or  symbol naming a package) or a list of package
    specifications.  The print name of any symbol is used as the  string  to
    identify  a package.  PACKAGE defaults to the current package (the value
    of *package*).

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The printed representation of package objects
    ;;  is implementation-dependent.
    <cl> (IN-PACKAGE :MY-PACKAGE)
    #<The MY-PACKAGE package, 0 internal, 0 external>
    <cl> (setq my-sym 3)
    3
    <cl> (EXPORT 'MY-SYM)
    t
    <cl> (IN-PACKAGE :YOUR-PACKAGE)
    #<The YOUR-PACKAGE package, 0 internal, 0 external>
    <cl> (USE-PACKAGE :MY-PACKAGE)
    t
    <cl> MY-SYM
    3
    <cl> (UNUSE-PACKAGE :MY-PACKAGE :YOUR-PACKAGE)
    t
    <cl> MY-SYM
    Error: Attempt to take the value of the unbound symbol my-sym
    [1] <cl>
    ;;  The error was signalled becase the symbol MY-SYM is
    ;;  no longer visible in YOUR-PACKAGE.
