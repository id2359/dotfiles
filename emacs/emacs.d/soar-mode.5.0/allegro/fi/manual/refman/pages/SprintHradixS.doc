    VARIABLE
    *print-radix*  -  variable whose value controls printing of radix
      specifiers for rational numbers

    DESCRIPTION
    When this variable is true, the COMMON LISP printer will print  a  radix
    specifier  whenever  a  rational  number  is  printed.   What is printed
    depends on the value of the radix.  The most common values 2, 8, 10, and
    16  all  have special designators.  Radixes 2, 8, and 16 are denoted #b,
    #o, and #x, respectively.  In base 10, integers have a trailing  decimal
    point  and  decimal  ratios  are  preceded  with  #10r  (lowercase `r').
    Radixes other than the special ones are represented #NR where N  is  the
    radix in decimal.

    If the value of this variable  is  nil,  which  is  the  default,  radix
    specifiers  will not be printed.  Recall that floating-point numbers are
    always printed in decimal.

    EXAMPLES
    (let ((*print-base* 2) *print-radix*)
      (format nil "~A" 5)) => "101"
    (let ((*print-base* 2) (*print-radix* t))
      (format nil "~A" 5)) => "#b101"
    (let ((*print-base* 10) *print-radix*)
      (format nil "~A" 5)) => "5"
    (let ((*print-base* 10) (*print-radix* t))
      (format nil "~A"5)) => "5."
    (let ((*print-base* 10) *print-radix*)
      (format nil "~A" 5/2)) => "5/2"
    (let ((*print-base* 10) (*print-radix* t))
      (format nil "~A"5/2)) => "#10r5/2"
    (let ((*print-base* 7) *print-radix*)
      (format nil "~A" 12)) => "15"
    (let ((*print-base* 7) (*print-radix* t))
      (format nil "~A" 12)) => "#7r15"
