    FUNCTION
    get-dispatch-macro-character  -  get the macro-character function for a
      dispatch-macro character sequence

    Usage
    get-dispatch-macro-character DISP-CHAR SUB-CHAR [TABLE]

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the macro-character function associated  with  the  sequence  of
    characters  consisting  of  DISP-CHAR,  followed  by  an  optional digit
    string, followed by SUB-CHAR,  in  the  readtable  specified  by  TABLE.
    TABLE  defaults  to  *readtable*.  An error is signalled if DISP-CHAR is
    not a dispatch character.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  We define the sequence ``#v'' followed by a number
    ;;  to be read as the sine of the number.

    (set-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\v
      #'(lambda (stream sub-char infix-argument)
         (declare (ignore sub-char infix-argument))
         (sin (read stream t nil t)))) => t
    #v0.0 => 0.0
    (pprint (get-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\v)) PRINTS
    (lambda (stream sub-char infix-argument)
      (declare (ignore sub-char infix-argument))
      (sin (read stream t nil t)))

    ;;  Usually the function assocated with a dispatch-macro character
    ;;  sequences is compiled, in which case this function returns a
    ;;  compiled function  object (whose name and printed representation
    ;;  are implemenation-dependent).
    (get-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\')
