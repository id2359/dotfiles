    FUNCTION
    finish-output  -  ensure that all output has reached its destination

    Usage
    finish-output [STREAM]

    SIDE EFFECTS
    Buffered characters intended for stream STREAM are output.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil after buffered characters have been output to STREAM.   This
    function  differs  from  force-output in that it attempts to ensure that
    all output has reached  its  destination  before  returning  nil,  while
    force-output  returns at once.  However, the behavior and effect of this
    function is implementation-dependent.

    The argument STREAM must be a stream, nil, or t.  If it is nil  (or  the
    STREAM  argument is not supplied), the stream used is *standard-output*.
    If it is t, the stream used is *terminal-io*.

    EXAMPLES
    (finish-output) => nil
