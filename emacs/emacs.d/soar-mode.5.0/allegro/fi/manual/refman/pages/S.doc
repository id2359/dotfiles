    VARIABLE
    *  -  the first value returned from +

    Usage
    *

    DESCRIPTION
    The value of * is the first value returned from the  evaluation  of  the
    form  in  +.  This variable is not updated if the evaluation is aborted.
    If no values are returned, * is nil.  If multiple values were  returned,
    then  *  contains only the first one.  (If the printing of the values is
    aborted, * will already have been updated.) This variable exists for the
    convenience  of  the user when interacting with a COMMON LISP top level.
    (Note: this variable is unconnected with the function  *  which  is  the
    generalized multiplication function.)

    "The value of pi squared is roughly 10
    "
    <cl> (SETQ X 3)
