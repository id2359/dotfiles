    Type SPECIFIER
    satisfies  -  specify a data type as the set of objects satisfying a
      predicate

    USAGE
    (satisfies pred)

    DESCRIPTION
    Specifies a data type consisting of those  objects  that  satisfy  PRED,
    which  must  be  a symbol. PRED must name a global function, one defined
    with defun rather than flet or labels, that is a function of  one  argu-
    ment  and  that  returns true or false depending on whether its argument
    satisfies some condition.  Note that PRED may not be  a  lambda  expres-
    sion.

    EXAMPLES
    (typep 2 '(and integer (satisfies evenp))) => t
    (typep 3 '(and integer (satisfies evenp))) => nil
