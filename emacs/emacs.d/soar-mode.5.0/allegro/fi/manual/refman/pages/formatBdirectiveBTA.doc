    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~&  -  print newline character if not already on new line

    USAGE
    ~count&

    DESCRIPTION
    Prints a newline unless it is known that the output  stream  is  already
    positioned  at  the  beginning  of  a  line (using fresh-line), and then
    prints COUNT - 1 newlines.  The default for COUNT is 1.  Printing a new-
    line means printing a #\newline character.

    EXAMPLES
    (let ()
      (format t "Hello world.~%")
      (format t "~%Good~%")
      (format t "~&Bye.~%")) => nil
    PRINTS
    Hello world.
    Good
    Bye.

    The results of this directive are implementation-dependent.
