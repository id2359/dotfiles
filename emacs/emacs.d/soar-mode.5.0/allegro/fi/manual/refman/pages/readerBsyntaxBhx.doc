    READER SYNTAX
    #x  -  representation of a hexadecimal rational

    Usage
    #X...

    DESCRIPTION
    Reads as a rational number expressed in hexadecimal radix.

    When the reader reads the dispatch-macro  character  ``#''  followed  by
    ``x''  or  ``X'',  these  characters are discarded and the next token is
    read as the hexadecimal representation of a rational number.   The  only
    valid  characters  in  such  a  representation are the digits from ``0''
    through ``9'' and the letters, either uppercase or lowercase, from ``A''
    through  ``F''.   The ``#x'' syntactic form reads as the rational number
    represented by the token.

    The ``#r'' syntactic form permits specification of  any  allowed  radix.
    Floating-point numbers are always read in decimal.

    Rational numbers are self-evaluating objects.  (In fact all numbers  are
    self-evaluating.)

    EXAMPLES
    #xace => 2766
    #x0a/f0 => 1/24

    (setf *read-base* 20.)
    #x0a/f0 => 1/24

    (setf *print-base* 16.)
    #x0a/f0 => 1/18
    10. => a
    10 => 14
