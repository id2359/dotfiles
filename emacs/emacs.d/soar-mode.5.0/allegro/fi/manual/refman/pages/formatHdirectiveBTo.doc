    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~(  -  process control string with case conversion

    USAGE
    ~[:][@](string~)

    DESCRIPTION
    Processes a string as a o.E format  control  string  and  performs  case
    conversion according to the ``:'' and ``@'' modifiers.

    ~(   Converts all uppercase characters to lowercase.

    ~:(  Capitalizes all words, as if with string-capitalize.

    ~@(  Capitalizes only the first word and converts the rest to lowercase.

    ~:@( Converts all lowercase characters to uppercase.

    This directive must nest properly with respect to other  format  control
    structure  directives.   The  ``~^''  directive may be used to terminate
    processing prematurely.

    EXAMPLES
    (format nil "~@(~A~) ~(~A~) did not write ~:(~A~)."
      "the poet" "E.E. Cummings" "the illiad")
      => "The poet e.e. cummings did not write The Illiad."
    (format nil "Yes, ~:(~A~), you may have won ~:@(~R~) dollars!"
      "john doe" 40000000)
      => "Yes, John Doe, you may have won FORTY MILLION dollars!"
