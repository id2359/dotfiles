    FUNCTION
    array-row-major-index  -  gets the row-major index of an array element
      given its subscripts

    USAGE
    array-row-major-index array {subscript}*

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns the index of the given array element according to row-major ord-
    ering.   Each  SUBSCRIPT  must  be  a non-negative integer less than the
    corresponding dimension in ARRAY, and the  total  number  of  subscripts
    must equal the rank of the array.  This function ignores fill pointers.

    EXAMPLES
    (array-row-major-index (make-array '(3 4)) 2 3) => 11
    (array-row-major-index
      (make-array '(15) :fill-pointer 12) 13) => 13
    (array-row-major-index (make-array nil)) => 0
