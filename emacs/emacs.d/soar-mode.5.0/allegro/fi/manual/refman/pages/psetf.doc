    MACRO
    psetf  -  set the values of generalized variables in parallel (destruc-
      tive)

    USAGE
    psetf {place value}*

    SIDE EFFECTS
    Each location PLACE is modified to hold the corresponding value VALUE.

    DESCRIPTION
    Returns nil, but this macro is used for its side effects.  Each PLACE is
    a generalized variable.  When PLACE is a symbol, what is modified is the
    value of the variable named by the symbol in the context  in  which  the
    psetf  form  appears.   This  value  may be associated with a lexical or
    dynamic binding or it may be a global value.  (Thus a psetf of a  symbol
    is  identical  functionally  to  a  psetq of a symbol.) If more than one
    PLACE and VALUE pair is specified,  then  the  pairs  are  processed  in
    parallel,  and  thus the new values are not visible to the later VALUES.
    (The VALUES are evaluated left to right but the assignments may be  done
    in  any  order,  which matters only if two of the PLACE arguments denote
    the same location).

    EXAMPLES
    (setq x 4) => 4
    (psetf x 5 y x) => nil
    x => 5
    y => 4
    (setq lis '(a b c))
    (psetf (car lis) 'z (cadr lis) (car lis))
    lis => (z a c)
