    CONSTANT
    short-float-epsilon  -  smallest distinguishable short-float increment

    DESCRIPTION
    Evaluates to the smallest positive short-float number that can be  added
    to  1 to produce a value distinct from 1.  The value of this constant is
    implementation-dependent.

    EXAMPLES
    ;;  The returned value is implementation-dependent.
    short-float-epsilon => 1.1920929e-7
