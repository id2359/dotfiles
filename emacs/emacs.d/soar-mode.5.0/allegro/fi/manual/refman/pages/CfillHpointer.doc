    KEYWORD ARGUMENT
    :fill-pointer  -  specify a fill pointer for the result array in
      make-array and adjust-array

    USAGE
    :fill-pointer pointer

    DESCRIPTION
    This  keyword  argument  may  be  used   with   either   make-array   or
    adjust-array.   When  specified to make-array, the array that is created
    will have a fill pointer.  When used with adjust-array, the fill pointer
    of the array is adjusted.  The array must be one dimensional, that is, a
    vector. The argument POINTER sets the value of the fill  pointer,  which
    is the index of the first inactive element of the vector.  This argument
    must be an integer greater than or equal to zero, and less than or equal
    to  the  length  of  the  array.  Most  functions  that  operate on one-
    dimensional arrays (for example, vector-push and vector-pop) operate  on
    active elements only. The important exception is aref.

    The argument POINTER may also be t, in which case the  fill  pointer  is
    set to the length of the vector.

    EXAMPLES
    (setq A (make-array '(10) :adjustable t
                        :initial-element 1
                        :fill-pointer 5 )) => #(1 1 1 1 1)
    ;;  The index cannot exceed the fill pointer in some functions.
    (elt A 9) => ERROR
    (aref A 9) =>  1
    (length A) => 5
    (map 'list 'identity A) => (1 1 1 1 1)
